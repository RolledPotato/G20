WEBVTT

00:00.000 --> 00:04.880
I'm burnt down screw this we need just 20 million dollars Netflix. How much would you pay me?

00:04.880 --> 00:08.560
Yeah, we're in to do every other day. We'd have mental breakdowns. You're funny. You want a job?

00:08.560 --> 00:13.840
Just put this out there. I did not enjoy being married. Why? She's a quarrelist right now.

00:14.880 --> 00:16.560
So I make videos.

00:17.280 --> 00:21.200
What's up everyone? Welcome to the Colin and Samir show. I'm Samir. I'm Colin and every

00:21.200 --> 00:24.960
week on this channel we talk about the latest in the world of creators. So if that interests you,

00:24.960 --> 00:29.200
make sure to subscribe. After we put out our breakdown video about our time with Mr. Beast,

00:29.200 --> 00:34.080
a lot of people in the comments were asking for the full interview. This is the longest episode

00:34.080 --> 00:39.680
on our channel, but for us experiencing 72 hours with Jimmy was so educational and we pulled so much

00:39.680 --> 00:43.680
value from just being with him. I feel like spending the time to watch this full interview can

00:43.680 --> 00:48.000
really teach you a lot about Mr. Beast and just a lot about the career of being a creator.

00:48.000 --> 00:51.280
This episode of the Colin and Samir shows brought to you by Jelly Smack. If you want to check

00:51.280 --> 00:56.640
them out, the link is in the description, but more on them later in this episode. Colin, roll the intro.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.120
All right, so I have a question for you. Can you describe to everyone watching where we are right now?

01:07.120 --> 01:10.880
Yes, so I got a mic on so I can move around a little bit.

01:10.880 --> 01:15.760
I just bought this brand new studio and a hundred acres of land around it.

01:16.320 --> 01:20.480
This is where we're filming all our videos going from, not all, but all our indoor shoots going

01:20.480 --> 01:25.520
forward. I mean, ask me more questions. There's so much to talk about. How much do this cost and

01:25.520 --> 01:30.640
how long in the making has this been? So the land around it, obviously the studio, the renovations

01:30.640 --> 01:34.800
and everything, and obviously we don't pay it all up front, but in total it'll cost over $10 million.

01:34.800 --> 01:38.880
But it's probably not a good way to start it because there's so much explanation. It seems

01:38.880 --> 01:45.120
excessive. Why would you just buy this? The reason we bought this is because I've spent the entire

01:45.120 --> 01:49.280
day explaining to you, we had office and a bigger office than a studio, than a bigger studio,

01:49.280 --> 01:55.600
than a third studio, and now it's consolidating. It's a weird way to start it because now it just

01:55.600 --> 01:59.840
sounds like I'm being expensive and lavish for no reason. There's a strategic reason why.

01:59.840 --> 02:04.240
You know what I mean? You obviously, you started in your bedroom at the cost of zero.

02:04.240 --> 02:08.640
Exactly. But still, I'd love to work our way up, not just go, hey, look at this because now I

02:08.640 --> 02:14.720
just seem like some dumber to YouTube. So not only are we here in your brand new studio,

02:14.720 --> 02:18.800
we're here in your hometown. And I think that's been one of the most interesting things to

02:18.800 --> 02:23.680
experience is spending a day with you here, even spending time with your mom, even some of the

02:23.680 --> 02:30.240
places in the context, that's a fun sentence. But even spending time here in your hometown,

02:30.240 --> 02:34.000
like we've met people who grew up with you, which is really interesting. Like everyone asks us,

02:34.000 --> 02:37.360
like I think people know that we're from out of town. So like, hey, what are you guys doing here?

02:37.360 --> 02:40.480
Yeah. We're filming, you know, some content. They're like, oh, Mr. Beast.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.240
Yeah. Oh, I played baseball with him. And it's really interesting to meet people and

02:46.240 --> 02:52.640
recognize like you are still in your hometown. And a lot of people who are from small towns in the

02:52.640 --> 02:59.520
US, they think like, I got to get out of this town to find success. So why did you stay in this

02:59.520 --> 03:04.800
town? And how do you think you found success staying here? Honestly, it really was easier to just

03:04.800 --> 03:09.920
stay here. You know, as I started making the videos bigger and bigger and hiring people and

03:09.920 --> 03:14.960
I got warehouses and studios like you get so anchored down like, well, you're just going to

03:14.960 --> 03:20.560
relocate all your employees to LA and buy a studio space there that costs 10 times more. And why?

03:20.560 --> 03:24.800
You know, like, what are the negatives of being in a small town? I would argue with the internet

03:24.800 --> 03:29.200
and things like zoom where you can talk to everyone and we're so interconnected like there really

03:29.200 --> 03:34.560
is no need to pay 12% more tax because of what is it? State tax in California. And then on top of

03:34.560 --> 03:39.040
that pay like three to five times more for rent and all this other stuff. It's kind of it's almost

03:39.040 --> 03:43.200
silly to be there for people in our position. Did it ever cross your mind though that maybe you're

03:43.200 --> 03:47.440
missing out on opportunity to collaborate like not really never. No, I mean, if you're good enough

03:47.440 --> 03:51.360
friends with someone they'll come down like you guys can down here. There's someone I really want

03:51.360 --> 03:55.280
to hang out with like or actually just fly there when I need to that blog is going to know I mean it's

03:55.280 --> 04:00.560
dead now. Thank you. Thank you for getting rid of it. But you know, like if I really want to hang out

04:00.560 --> 04:03.760
with someone they can just come down. You know what I mean? It's like a four hour flight. Yeah,

04:03.760 --> 04:07.600
I actually think on the inverse spending the day with you and like shadowing what at least half a

04:07.600 --> 04:10.800
day looks like I don't even think we saw your full day. We met up with you in the middle of the

04:10.800 --> 04:14.720
day. That's true. Yeah. And it was like boom, boom, boom, we were going like thing to thing to

04:14.720 --> 04:19.920
thing. And I think what I realized was being somewhere like this the positives actually outweigh

04:19.920 --> 04:24.960
the negatives so much in that there's so much focus. And you are like you're really moving from

04:24.960 --> 04:29.920
thing to thing to thing. Like I think we watched you workshop about four videos in such a short

04:29.920 --> 04:34.560
amount of time. Yeah. And that I thought was one of the most interesting things and just sitting

04:34.560 --> 04:39.200
there in those meetings, understanding how you're thinking about what needs to happen. And then

04:39.200 --> 04:44.080
additionally having the facilities and the team members who are ready to custom make things for

04:44.080 --> 04:47.920
the stories. Like I don't know if people realize I didn't realize and I've been watching your videos

04:47.920 --> 04:53.360
I've talked to you we've interviewed you. I didn't realize that every set is like custom built

04:53.360 --> 04:58.800
for the video based on the story somewhere. Yeah. But I mean you would think that okay let's reuse

04:58.800 --> 05:02.960
that or let's you know we could let's see how many videos we can film in this set. Gotcha.

05:02.960 --> 05:07.840
But you know what I mean like it's just like it's part of the story. Great. So you started in

05:07.840 --> 05:16.000
your bedroom. Yep. What point did you start re like investing into the videos at a different

05:16.000 --> 05:22.080
scale? Great question. Literally put on me the entire time when I used to make like a dollar day

05:22.080 --> 05:26.880
I saved up for months and I bought a microphone way worse than this microphone and then I saved

05:26.880 --> 05:31.840
up for like half a year and I bought a computer. I and I the whole time was like recording on my

05:31.840 --> 05:35.920
iPhone. So I was recording and editing on my iPhone when I first started and then I got a microphone

05:35.920 --> 05:40.640
you can plug in. I got a computer to edit on and then after like two years of just filming on my

05:40.640 --> 05:45.520
phone I had a hundred plus thousand subscribers but I still didn't have a camera because there

05:45.520 --> 05:48.480
was things cost like a thousand bucks or I was stupid. I didn't realize you could probably like

05:48.480 --> 05:53.200
get you seven extra four hundred dollars. So then I bought a camera and after that I bought

05:53.200 --> 05:57.200
monitors for my computer and I just kept going and re investing and then I tip pizza delivery

05:57.200 --> 06:02.240
people a hundred bucks and then I tipped a homeless man 10 grand and then you know gave away cars

06:02.240 --> 06:07.840
gave away houses and last hand take take hand off a million dollars keeps in basically the entire

06:07.840 --> 06:12.880
time. So like for the last like eight or nine years like every dollar made I just spent it the

06:12.880 --> 06:16.880
next month on content and I just did that every single month and it just kept getting bigger and

06:16.880 --> 06:22.000
bigger and here we are. You give away millions of dollars now five hundred thousand dollars

06:22.000 --> 06:26.400
at a time like large sums of money but when you first started giving away five thousand or ten

06:26.800 --> 06:30.000
thousand. But it's first started with a hundred dollars literally like even less than that like

06:30.000 --> 06:33.840
donating like a ten bucks to twitch streamers and stuff like that but like the first real IRL

06:33.840 --> 06:37.680
one I would order a pizza and I'd tip a hundred bucks I think I did like three in that video

06:37.680 --> 06:41.120
so it was like three hundred dollars. But when it gets to ten thousand that's when I think

06:41.120 --> 06:45.200
the people and I would imagine people around you like your mom are probably like Jimmy what

06:45.920 --> 06:50.720
yep. Are you sure about that exactly like what was her reaction to that? Well so I did my first

06:50.800 --> 06:55.760
brand deal I'm sure you guys have heard the story but for people that know I was offered five grand

06:55.760 --> 07:00.720
for a video but this is when I was like 19 and there's so much money it's like mom look look and

07:01.600 --> 07:05.200
I was like double it and I'll walk outside and I'll give it to homeless person and they're like

07:05.200 --> 07:09.440
no you won't that's like double it and I like pacing around my name for three hours convincing

07:09.440 --> 07:14.080
this guy like on the phone just double the money I promise the video will go viral and I'll give

07:14.080 --> 07:17.120
it to homeless person I was like ten thousand dollars just looks better in a title it'll get more

07:17.120 --> 07:21.600
views I promise you're your apple do better and I end up getting ten thousand dollars and then

07:21.600 --> 07:25.280
gave it away and my mom's like why don't you just give it like eight thousand dollars nine thousand

07:25.280 --> 07:30.640
why all ten thousand I was like mommy will look better at the title and it's just better you know

07:30.640 --> 07:37.280
and that's basically that yeah how did you know that you know giving away a hundred bucks I guess

07:37.280 --> 07:42.000
it's natural but like why why does it make such good content like well I mean those things

07:42.080 --> 07:46.160
and then did something I've always enjoyed like even when I was I don't say poor I don't

07:46.160 --> 07:51.520
over dramaticize that my story like you know we weren't ever the poor but I didn't have as much

07:51.520 --> 07:56.160
money if I saw homeless person I would you know over my wallet and give them almost all the money

07:56.160 --> 08:00.640
had it's just fun you know because then you see the reaction their face light up stuff like that

08:00.640 --> 08:04.960
and so it kind of was just something I always enjoyed because there there's so much easier ways

08:04.960 --> 08:09.840
to give views back then then like having to give away money and and less stressful stuff but

08:09.840 --> 08:15.360
I just enjoyed it and I thought it was interesting to see people's reactions and like to try to like

08:15.360 --> 08:19.280
they're expecting a dollar and you give them 100 and they're like oh my god you know yeah um

08:19.280 --> 08:23.680
so just kind of like a mixture of what I thought was interesting but also what I enjoy if that

08:23.680 --> 08:28.480
makes sense were there other people when you're growing up making YouTube videos here around me

08:28.480 --> 08:32.880
yeah no no that was the biggest problem is I thought it was a freaking nature because like people

08:32.880 --> 08:37.360
would tell me all you do is talk about YouTube you're too obsessed with YouTube like get alive like

08:37.360 --> 08:44.640
from 13 to like 19 I never met anyone who cared about YouTube like not even out and so

08:44.640 --> 08:48.720
I was so untalkative people thought like there was problems with me because I just wouldn't

08:48.720 --> 08:52.560
talk to anyone because all I would do is talk about YouTube and after a while like you realize

08:52.560 --> 08:56.560
like no one cares like you just get labeled as the guy that just only likes YouTube and

08:56.560 --> 09:00.480
and so I kind of just like didn't talk at all and then when I was 19 and I had like 10,000

09:00.480 --> 09:04.800
subscribers maybe it's like 18 and that's when I started meeting a few other YouTubers online

09:04.800 --> 09:10.400
and I realized like I'm not a freak I'm just like obsessed with YouTube and that's okay is

09:10.400 --> 09:14.480
you know you just got to find other people that are like that most people want to talk about South

09:14.480 --> 09:19.200
Park when you're younger or when I was younger cartoons or whatever and I backed in was figure

09:19.200 --> 09:23.280
out how to drop ship or how to better edit a video or stuff like that like bring that up at a

09:23.280 --> 09:27.120
high school lunch table well I guess now people care yeah bring that up at a high school lunch table

09:27.120 --> 09:30.880
10 years ago and see what they say they're like the fuck you talking about what's interesting is I

09:30.880 --> 09:37.040
went back and I you know I did this a while ago but I did it recently again where I go to oldest

09:37.040 --> 09:41.280
uploaded videos on your channel you have some videos that are actually kind of similar to the videos

09:41.280 --> 09:47.440
we make where you were talking about other creators and how they were yeah yeah yeah yeah so you

09:47.440 --> 09:51.280
would play Call of Duty and then you would talk about yeah other creators I thought that was

09:51.280 --> 09:55.920
really interesting study so hardcore like there's I don't remember the youtubers name but some

09:55.920 --> 10:00.480
youtubers ad revenue he was hacked and it was leaked and it showed that he did made like 300

10:00.480 --> 10:04.800
grand over three years and I made like two videos on that and I was just so shocked I was like

10:04.800 --> 10:08.480
guys and I remember like telling everyone I know and they're all like who cares I was like guys

10:08.480 --> 10:13.120
youtubers can make money yeah yeah I thought it was just cool to be did you know they can make money

10:13.120 --> 10:18.240
I'm like a stupid teenager like really young I was like how is this possible I was like that's so

10:18.240 --> 10:24.240
much money that's more than like my mom makes you know like so many years and I was I was mind blown

10:24.720 --> 10:27.760
and like I would find stuff like that and just make videos on it because I thought it was cool

10:27.760 --> 10:31.760
and some of those like you were uploading Minecraft videos called duty videos did you have like a

10:31.760 --> 10:35.200
community when you first started uploading like did you notice people in the comments that were

10:35.200 --> 10:39.680
the same people not real there's like maybe like two or three people that would comment on each and

10:39.680 --> 10:44.720
back then which I think small youtubers should do is I would reply to every single comment and so

10:44.720 --> 10:48.560
I think a few people caught on that they would all I would always reply and so some people would

10:48.560 --> 10:52.720
just be like I wonder how long it'll take for them to reply and like so that was a lot of my

10:52.720 --> 10:56.960
comments when I was smaller but at least it kept them coming back and it's like it got to the

10:56.960 --> 11:00.720
point though I was getting hundreds a day and I was like okay like maybe I shouldn't spend an hour

11:00.720 --> 11:05.760
a day doing comments and so I dialed it back what type of content did you start feeling like okay

11:05.760 --> 11:10.800
now there's a like consistent subscriber base coming back to watch these videos that's a it's a

11:10.800 --> 11:17.360
hard one that one I honestly have no idea like this is so long ago it's all like a blur like I just

11:17.360 --> 11:22.000
remember like making videos and I remember being like dang like everyone's telling me like you're

11:22.000 --> 11:26.560
stupid you know you're very awkward like you know why would you make it there's a millions of

11:26.560 --> 11:31.040
people trying and I just remember feeling I don't know I just like it I'm gonna do this or I'm

11:31.040 --> 11:37.600
gonna die trying kind of thanks also I was a really big pussy back then but I just after just

11:37.600 --> 11:42.240
grinding year after year there's probably some blur between when I was 17 18 19 somewhere in

11:42.240 --> 11:46.000
there to start to get a little bit of views you know what I mean yeah it seems like sports is

11:46.000 --> 11:50.960
probably the most it's really like the only thing right like that's like the accepted thing

11:50.960 --> 11:55.840
here everywhere you drive it's like a baseball field there's basketball court soccer yeah we met

11:55.840 --> 11:58.720
someone today and they said they played baseball with you and then they also said that Chandler

11:58.720 --> 12:02.800
was really good at basketball yeah that was good yeah so maybe we'll have to take him on next

12:02.800 --> 12:08.400
I mean I don't say yeah well take him on like yeah yeah I mean that was good the footage isn't

12:08.400 --> 12:14.000
gonna show but I'll just show one from the basketball game last night yeah and I think they scored

12:14.000 --> 12:19.280
like two points okay okay four by the way yeah finished ten four ten four oh okay time we

12:19.280 --> 12:25.600
started filming in South Africa yeah and he scored like one basket he's like look I told you show

12:25.600 --> 12:30.480
me before this I just want to say that I had a steal before the basket I had the assist double

12:30.480 --> 12:33.680
double highlights it's interesting because it does seem like sports is like the most accepted

12:33.680 --> 12:39.920
thing here but you you dedicated yourself to something completely different and did you mind at all

12:39.920 --> 12:43.680
that feeling of like everyone being like what are you doing well of course I mean

12:44.880 --> 12:49.520
you just it's weird I think the problem is like if you I told this story years ago probably

12:49.520 --> 12:53.440
what to help it's so much more acceptable now like yeah everyone wants to be you too but everyone

12:53.440 --> 12:59.040
wants to be a tick-tock or like growing up now like you can just tell by the people and the numbers

12:59.040 --> 13:03.840
and explosion of social media that like it's a lot more widely accepted and also it might also be

13:03.840 --> 13:09.520
where I grew up in North Carolina it's different than LA but back then like it really just was a strange

13:09.520 --> 13:14.000
thing you know what I mean to like want to dedicate your life to being a youtuber and being

13:14.000 --> 13:19.760
that obsessed and so for me like there's probably like zero people and within a one hour radius of

13:19.760 --> 13:25.200
me that actually loved YouTube like I did and anything like that so it's just like if you wake up

13:25.200 --> 13:28.720
and every day you obsess over something and you live and breathe it and that's what you think about

13:28.720 --> 13:32.960
that's what you do that's what you study on and off that's what you stay up every night grinding

13:32.960 --> 13:38.480
and no one else even gives a flying **** about it it's like you just feel like a weirdo you know

13:38.560 --> 13:42.240
like an outcast and and I was also like just dumb back then I didn't realize oh well

13:42.240 --> 13:46.640
I just need to find different people I thought like oh my whole life I'll just never enjoy talking

13:46.640 --> 13:50.880
to people yeah and then I met other youtubers and then I started talking to them like 10 hours

13:50.880 --> 13:55.200
a day and like then that's when the channel really started taking off yeah one thing you said to

13:55.200 --> 14:00.800
us yesterday you sat and like kind of roasted some of our content or videos and it was like so

14:00.800 --> 14:04.960
informational and educational for us and it's not stuff that you haven't told us before but being

14:04.960 --> 14:09.600
around it is so important right yeah sitting in your meetings and understanding how important was

14:09.600 --> 14:15.280
that for you to develop a community online of of fans of friends friends beyond the importance like

14:15.280 --> 14:20.960
yeah that's just where you just so like imagine a world where it's just you working solo and you

14:20.960 --> 14:25.200
work 12 hours a day every day for like a year and you're just grinding you make a mistake you

14:25.200 --> 14:30.160
learn from it you grind you make you learn from it and you do that for like a year and imagine

14:30.160 --> 14:33.760
a different world where you have four friends who are also equally grinding and something similar

14:34.480 --> 14:38.000
friend number one makes a mistake on Friday he teaches the other four people friend number two

14:38.000 --> 14:41.760
makes mistake the next week teaches everyone and then like you're all learning from each other's

14:41.760 --> 14:47.040
mistakes you're all constantly studying 24 seven and downloading each other like after a year

14:47.040 --> 14:52.000
you're like two years ahead of the guy who was just solo it really does make a difference especially

14:52.000 --> 14:56.320
like my friend group when I was like I met a bunch of people and I had 10,000 subscribers and we all

14:56.320 --> 15:00.800
like we agreed not to drink we didn't do drugs like we didn't date we didn't do anything we just

15:00.880 --> 15:05.360
literally obsess from time we woke up to the time we went to bed that's literally all we did

15:05.360 --> 15:09.600
is it's wild like I've told this story before but for people who didn't listen to our other

15:09.600 --> 15:15.280
podcast like one day I literally got up and we had 18 hour Skype call and then I went to bed and

15:15.280 --> 15:19.680
that's all I did and we were just tearing apart YouTube videos studying trends and stuff like

15:19.680 --> 15:22.720
I don't even know how I got food like I'm pretty sure I was just ordering foods so I didn't

15:22.720 --> 15:27.600
have to leave my house so we could keep working like it was that level obsession it was just dumb it

15:27.600 --> 15:31.520
was so unhealthy you still talk to some of those people oh I talked to all of them well now I

15:31.520 --> 15:37.440
talked to most of them wow are any of them here in person with you now no no one of them his name

15:37.440 --> 15:43.440
is Dylan oh he said but he's the only guy I talked to yeah he's dude he was yeah I thought about

15:43.440 --> 15:48.240
him for the next week after that he's so smart yeah he's super sharp he's all calling about him

15:48.240 --> 15:54.400
yeah rebound yeah yeah he's really really sharp yeah I like him a lot and so he's always been

15:54.400 --> 15:58.160
kind of like my sounding board and like if I have a question like I'm like I don't know what to do

15:58.160 --> 16:02.640
like he's usually pretty good at helping me think it out like I've probably spent 10,000 hours

16:02.640 --> 16:07.600
talking to him over over the course of like the last six years it's it's wild yeah I think what's

16:07.600 --> 16:12.160
interesting is that you know you made all these friends and you had to Skype them right like no one

16:12.160 --> 16:15.200
was here with you in person because we were spending time with you yesterday I mean there's

16:15.200 --> 16:21.840
people everywhere serious organization not only is that was back when I edited my videos

16:21.840 --> 16:26.480
set them all up tore them all down did literally everything all by myself I didn't have like a single

16:26.480 --> 16:30.720
employee until like four years ago like personally for me I've had a it's been tough for me to add

16:30.720 --> 16:34.320
employees because I have a hard time like giving up control and I don't understand I don't

16:34.320 --> 16:38.400
always know how to manage yeah that's like that's like a really good strength of some years uh-huh

16:38.400 --> 16:43.920
how did you go uh from even just making that decision to hire one person it was is brutally hard for

16:43.920 --> 16:48.720
me man the first time I was just an editor and even then it's like because I I'm so particular

16:48.720 --> 16:53.520
on how I wanted it he used I so and I also didn't have office or anything when I first started so

16:53.520 --> 16:58.160
I just set up a computer in my room and he would come over and edit the videos after I finished and

16:58.160 --> 17:02.960
I would just watch him edit and then I just like uh why'd you cut that why did you cut this that's

17:02.960 --> 17:08.720
every editor's dream yeah it's to have someone sit there I know I know I know I know but as like well

17:08.720 --> 17:12.560
like you know I every YouTuber says it's like no one will ever be able to replicate my style it's

17:12.560 --> 17:18.080
I got to edit it but news flash someone can it's actually not as difficult as you think but back then

17:18.080 --> 17:21.600
you know I'm a teenager I didn't understand that at the start it was just a lot of like

17:21.600 --> 17:25.920
micro managing like that but even then it's still freed up so much time because I just kind of

17:25.920 --> 17:30.960
got to the point where I was like I can't stand editing I had to edit it probably like a thousand

17:30.960 --> 17:35.040
plus videos in my life at that point between that channel and other things that I'd done I was just

17:35.040 --> 17:40.720
like I just don't want to do this I just want to make videos and so that that first one and then

17:40.720 --> 17:44.880
I just was like oh well I don't know I bring like I think I did a video where we like smashed

17:44.880 --> 17:49.360
4,000 plates like dropped them to see how they'd break and it's like well I'm gonna hire just

17:49.360 --> 17:53.360
someone to help me pick up these plates and you know hire someone to help with this and and then it

17:53.360 --> 17:57.520
just you know I started with like two or three people and then every month I just hire someone

17:57.520 --> 18:03.120
else as the videos got bigger and here we are four years later yeah almost every podcast I feel

18:03.120 --> 18:06.960
like you've been on or every time you talk about YouTube you always talk about how you reinvest

18:06.960 --> 18:10.720
everything back into the channel literally everything and I think spending time with you here what I

18:10.720 --> 18:15.680
noticed is that's actually not just money it's time yeah you also reinvest all of your time

18:15.680 --> 18:20.480
to reinvest yeah you invest all of your time into it and I think that's something that is

18:20.480 --> 18:25.120
beneficial of of being where you are is that you have that ability and then also the concept of

18:25.120 --> 18:31.760
hiring is just so that you have more time to invest exactly right yeah a lot of people like

18:31.760 --> 18:35.040
again the thing is everyone has different priorities you know if you want to make a few hundred

18:35.040 --> 18:39.920
grand a year and you know toast or whatever like you know not everyone has ambition and stuff

18:40.080 --> 18:44.080
but if you really do want to be the best you can possibly be the biggest YouTuber

18:44.080 --> 18:47.040
you should look at hiring as a way to free up your time so you can do more important things

18:47.040 --> 18:52.160
than even then and hyper optimize every little minute and anything that isn't work you should

18:52.160 --> 18:57.120
outsource to someone else you can recharge so you can work again you know yeah so we also went

18:57.120 --> 19:02.800
to multiple spaces while we were here when did you start filming or when did you get your first

19:02.800 --> 19:08.480
space outside of your bedroom oh that's a hard one I mean the videos just kept getting so much bigger

19:08.480 --> 19:13.920
I can't tell you which video but it did just with the wind if you watch my videos when I stop

19:13.920 --> 19:18.960
filming in my room and I started filming outside I it gets so hot here as I don't want to just film

19:18.960 --> 19:25.840
outside and I burned so easily and so then we got the there's like an old firefighter building or

19:25.840 --> 19:30.400
whatever like the floor was yellow is hideous there's two garage doors with a fire truck to come

19:30.400 --> 19:35.360
in it out that's where we are first ever like studio is a really small warehouse I started off

19:35.440 --> 19:40.880
in my bedroom like we talked about earlier and then I got a little office building like one room

19:40.880 --> 19:45.280
basically but it's two rooms they weren't really that big and then we all grew that in like three

19:45.280 --> 19:50.000
months and then and you know my mom told you guys the story yesterday and then I got a bunch more

19:50.000 --> 19:55.040
office space like four or five offices and then I got like a little warehouse then I got a bigger

19:55.040 --> 19:59.360
warehouse and then I got I kind of like a campus like two warehouses because like the videos are

19:59.360 --> 20:03.760
getting so big and you have to be you have to work on multiple videos at a time because most our

20:03.760 --> 20:08.560
videos takes months to produce and I don't just upload two or three videos a year so if you're

20:08.560 --> 20:13.520
working on like five videos at a time and one of the videos takes up an entire warehouse and another

20:13.520 --> 20:16.800
video takes up an entire warehouse well then you can't work on the other three because two warehouses

20:16.800 --> 20:21.200
are full so then that's what led us to getting this big place because it's so huge we can

20:21.200 --> 20:26.000
work on multiple videos here at the same time that just for you two versus that or wonder like how

20:26.000 --> 20:30.560
do you get to this point like it's usually a slow snowball you know when you're first starting you're

20:30.560 --> 20:36.080
saying okay I'm now making X amount of money I can spend X amount of money on my videos I'm

20:36.080 --> 20:42.480
saying I made money I spend money yes all of it forever the thing that we not only

20:42.480 --> 20:46.160
I'm realizing from talking to you but actually sitting with your mom and looking at

20:46.160 --> 20:51.680
yeah something my finance yeah so Jimmy's sat us down and showed us his finances which

20:52.400 --> 20:57.200
was amazing it was so educational but the thing that is I showed him how I lost half a million

20:57.200 --> 21:03.760
dollars on a video so you go from making money spending money to making money losing money

21:03.760 --> 21:08.320
yeah on some video on some videos right to make money to go for it yeah so I guess I was

21:08.320 --> 21:12.640
going to ask you like when did you get that comfort level of saying I'll actually spend I'm okay

21:12.640 --> 21:16.560
with the entire time the entire time ever since I was 13 I'm even though I was a monetized

21:16.560 --> 21:21.600
at 13 I know I think I got monetized I was like 15 or 16 but ever since I got my first YouTube

21:21.600 --> 21:26.320
paycheck I just always spent it back on YouTube was that because the belief was distribution is the

21:26.320 --> 21:31.200
most valuable thing I just wanted to be the biggest YouTuber I could be as not like I mean I don't

21:31.200 --> 21:36.640
know I'm a dumb 15-year-old like all my friends play what is it balloon tower defense class and talk

21:36.640 --> 21:42.320
about that I don't know I just want to make better videos and then and I just want to make

21:42.320 --> 21:46.480
better videos and I mean now I'm a lot more strategic but back then it was just like I just want

21:46.480 --> 21:52.000
good videos you know what was your relationship to money when you were growing up I mean it's hard

21:52.080 --> 21:56.640
because I don't want to like overplay it you know it's not like I was like wearing where my next

21:56.640 --> 22:02.080
meal would come from but we weren't we weren't the most well off like there it was very quickly

22:02.080 --> 22:06.240
came to a point where I was making more on like a single brand deal than my mom made an entire year

22:06.240 --> 22:12.080
and she was like raising me and my brother and sister and stuff like that um it was but did

22:12.080 --> 22:17.200
you desire money like when you're younger I've only won money so I can make better videos so

22:17.280 --> 22:23.520
I can grow on my channel yeah but it's like no I mean like dude like the the type of stuff I do now

22:23.520 --> 22:28.160
is would have been unfathomable to anyone back when I was younger it's like so unfathomable it's

22:28.160 --> 22:33.360
crazy like if you told me when I was like 15 that one day I'd make a hundred grand a year I would

22:33.360 --> 22:36.960
have been like what the fuck yeah make that kind of money right like I thought it was crazy

22:36.960 --> 22:41.360
that I used to remain like 300 grand over the course of a few years so you know I mean like it's

22:41.840 --> 22:47.440
like it's pretty brutal like you know a few hundred bucks was like out of this world insane back then

22:47.440 --> 22:51.600
you know yeah the video we talked about yesterday where you lost half a million dollars on that

22:51.600 --> 22:56.800
though when when you look at that number does that worry you well no I mean at the end of the day I

22:56.800 --> 23:01.440
could spend less per videos if I want to I'm just focused on making the best videos possible

23:01.440 --> 23:05.200
period I don't care about making money I don't care about time I don't care about I just want to

23:05.200 --> 23:11.040
make the best videos on the planet but at any point if I was like oh I need to stop losing money I

23:11.040 --> 23:16.480
just you know don't spend a million dollars on the next video just spend a hundred great yeah

23:16.480 --> 23:21.040
one thing Colin and I were talking about yesterday after we left we were like this is I think

23:21.040 --> 23:25.600
Colin mentioned to you that this feels like the modern day movie studio right like we're going into

23:25.600 --> 23:31.120
creative meetings we're listening to development we're understanding like production problems that

23:31.120 --> 23:35.600
you guys are trying to solve a youhaul drove in here yeah this morning and we didn't even we didn't

23:35.600 --> 23:39.120
even feel like there was something in here there was a huge truck in here and we were just

23:39.120 --> 23:44.240
went about our yeah I guess yeah that's normal yeah that's normal here that's fine yeah that's

23:44.240 --> 23:48.720
funny did they come to get stuff from yeah they came big they pick up stuff but it's a it's a modern day

23:48.720 --> 23:53.440
movie studio but you're actually even at spending $200,000 for what you're making for the type of

23:53.440 --> 24:00.400
distribution getting it's actually way less than TV spending yeah right now it's it's interesting

24:00.400 --> 24:04.720
too because if I go to them I'm like hey it's just for fun you know that's like hey you want to

24:04.720 --> 24:12.320
give me some money to produce a TV show like no I guess I'll just yeah I have no interest in

24:12.320 --> 24:16.800
doing that type of stuff yeah but it's funny because sometimes I poke at them to like see they'll

24:16.800 --> 24:22.160
give me money and and no one I guess they just don't believe that I can do dope stuff with like

24:22.160 --> 24:25.920
a million dollars like even just something as simple as like a million dollars in episode like

24:25.920 --> 24:30.800
just go give away money to people yeah they'd be like no and it's like I spend that for almost

24:30.800 --> 24:36.800
my YouTube at this point and I know it would like kill it for them yeah I mean I think I just

24:36.800 --> 24:39.920
want to be a YouTuber I don't really care to do that type of stuff but you know it's always fun

24:39.920 --> 24:45.600
to be like hey Netflix how much would you pay me right all right quick break from our conversation

25:52.080 --> 25:57.840
tell them Colin and Samir sent you all right back to North Carolina and our interview with mr.

25:57.840 --> 26:02.160
beast I mean part of like seeing all the different spaces was we met all these different teams it

26:02.160 --> 26:06.640
felt like there was so many different department so many different teams that we met and everyone

26:06.640 --> 26:10.640
first of all is incredibly nice here everyone has been so nice to us like we feel incredibly

26:10.640 --> 26:16.960
taken care of but outside of that like everyone is such like you've curated a team of people who

26:16.960 --> 26:22.880
are just so hard working it's like all about the work yeah there's no fluff or bless I agree we

26:22.880 --> 26:28.480
got a lot of great people here and obviously you know like the videos we do where I'm now drawing

26:28.480 --> 26:32.480
blank like selling houses for a dollar yeah I'm putting a million rupees in someone's backyard or

26:32.480 --> 26:37.520
whatever the stupid things are doing or filling a person's house with slime like I can't do that on

26:37.520 --> 26:44.560
my own obviously I need help so uh bless yeah so how did you go from hiring one editor to hiring the

26:44.560 --> 26:48.560
next person the next person it's literally just like it's not like I just woke up one day and I have

26:48.560 --> 26:52.880
dozens of employees like it's just like I've literally just been hiring like a person a month for

26:52.880 --> 26:57.840
the last four years like you know it's the videos it's like it's also not like you know I gave a

26:57.840 --> 27:02.240
homeless guy 10 grand and then you know the next day I'm buying everything in five stores you know

27:02.240 --> 27:06.960
and I'm needing a hundred people to fill dozens of you halls and stuff like it's just a slow

27:06.960 --> 27:11.440
progression up and along the way we just pick up a person and another person another and how do you

27:11.440 --> 27:15.600
find people because I think that's something that youtubers have a really hard time with I don't

27:15.600 --> 27:20.240
really know I mean I've been doing like I said four years like yeah it's a very very very slow

27:20.240 --> 27:26.560
grind hiring all these people I honestly they're way more qualified people for that if someone knows

27:26.560 --> 27:32.720
how to find great out please reach out to me I'll pay you yeah I I personally loved the creative

27:32.720 --> 27:37.520
meetings I thought those were the most interesting to be in just the way you guys are thinking in

27:37.520 --> 27:43.200
the way like everything has to fit together and you're thinking obviously very much in in like

27:43.200 --> 27:48.080
terms of retention but your whole team is also thinking the exact same way yeah and like the problem

27:48.080 --> 27:55.600
solving you guys are doing is so specific to you know what I mean like it's not it's not problem

27:55.600 --> 27:58.720
solving that if you walked into a movie studio that they're thinking about and I think actually

27:58.720 --> 28:03.200
that's some of the problem with what's happening in Hollywood is that they are thinking about the

28:03.200 --> 28:07.120
fact that something on Netflix is competing with one of your videos do you know what I mean like

28:07.120 --> 28:11.040
when I'm on I'm watching an internet video whether it's Netflix or YouTube like you're on the

28:11.040 --> 28:15.520
same plank field so yeah you actually have to compete in the same well I'm sure they shoot for

28:15.520 --> 28:20.240
retention as well we're just we're very very serious about it though I don't like using cinematic

28:20.240 --> 28:25.200
shots or you know unless like you have multiple cam setups here like if I'm talking to this

28:25.200 --> 28:29.360
camera you're not cutting it for too long that's boring you'll lose retention but if I talk and

28:29.360 --> 28:34.960
you cut to that angle I'm talking to cut back and you know it helps it and it's not bad to be

28:34.960 --> 28:39.040
obsessed like if people aren't cleaning up that means they're entertained you know so I'm hyper

28:39.040 --> 28:43.280
obsessed with just making sure people actually like what they're watching yeah yeah yeah I think

28:43.280 --> 28:48.560
the thing is that we don't Netflix sure cares about retention but they're grabbing content from all

28:48.560 --> 28:53.120
over from people who aren't basing all of their data and analytics off 10 years of just uploading to

28:53.120 --> 28:58.480
Netflix right yeah that's what's entirely different about creating for YouTube is that you're

28:58.480 --> 29:03.600
taking the metrics from one place and have been for the last decade or more right is it just gets

29:03.600 --> 29:08.800
OP when you just do it and and you just study year after year after year after year and you learn

29:08.800 --> 29:13.680
from every mistake and you have other people doing it and you're teaching each other and like like

29:13.680 --> 29:18.160
if you want to be a YouTuber if you're watching this right like and you're thinking into scale of

29:18.160 --> 29:23.600
10 years like if you literally are grinding and you're obsessed and you're just every day studying

29:24.000 --> 29:29.040
and learning and you surround yourself with smart people and you just work like hell to be honest

29:29.040 --> 29:32.960
for 10 years like there's probably a good chance you'll make it but if you do that over the course

29:32.960 --> 29:39.680
six months or a year I don't know you know but that's why like I like to think over a span of a

29:39.680 --> 29:43.680
decade a lot of people are very short-term cited but you know as long as you're innovating adapting

29:43.680 --> 29:49.280
reinvesting I think if you do it intelligently like you have a good odds of I don't know like killing

29:49.840 --> 29:55.280
after we hung out yesterday I went back and watched the FBI video again and I watched the first 40

29:55.280 --> 29:59.520
seconds and I was sitting with Colin showing him like a lot of what we talked about I was seeing

29:59.520 --> 30:04.640
in those first 40 seconds and I was like you really do all those things and those first 40 seconds

30:04.640 --> 30:10.000
were so jam-packed and you introduced so many new things like so much new stuff between both

30:10.000 --> 30:15.360
the visuals too I mean even the the concept that you say in the first 40 seconds first of all the

30:15.360 --> 30:19.600
visuals are already changing but you also say there's an NFL stadium there's a private

30:19.600 --> 30:24.080
chat and there's a maze this is why you should watch the video yeah see these things yeah yeah

30:24.080 --> 30:28.080
and like the the thing people undervalue the most is literally the first 10 seconds of the video

30:28.080 --> 30:33.120
like yeah I can almost I think I can quote it I tied up an FBI agent I have a hundred thousand

30:33.120 --> 30:37.440
dollars in this bag here's a knife good luck and I just run away like it gives you everything

30:37.440 --> 30:42.880
you need yeah no wasted words short concise and then tension how much time do you spend on those

30:42.960 --> 30:48.720
openings I'm a perfectionist I really it's so important like that's your first impression for

30:48.720 --> 30:52.960
everyone clicking on the video so like I like the whole time leading up to that I'm just constantly

30:52.960 --> 30:57.600
obsessed with mostly the first minute just like making sure like if I were to click on this video

30:57.600 --> 31:01.600
I would like the first minute and that it would hook me you know me yeah you had a video of ours

31:01.600 --> 31:05.280
that you said you were interested in the thumbnail you clicked on it you're bored after five seconds

31:05.280 --> 31:09.840
I can tell you it was the one about the hype house yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah and I showed them on my

31:09.840 --> 31:14.880
phone I was like I I the title of the thumbnail made me tap and the red bar was like so tiny you

31:14.880 --> 31:18.880
could barely see it cuz I clicked on it eight seconds I was like this is me and my house four days

31:18.880 --> 31:24.000
ago before you came down clearly you just didn't grab me yeah yeah and that was really eye opening

31:24.000 --> 31:29.360
for us and we now you recognize like I think a lot of times you you talk about obsessing over the

31:29.360 --> 31:34.320
content and and really getting into it and I think sometimes it's hard to understand what that

31:34.320 --> 31:39.600
exactly means and then when you said that I was like oh that's what it means it literally means

31:39.600 --> 31:44.880
that there's a there was a big problem and you predicted that about 40% of the people left

31:44.880 --> 31:50.720
in 10 seconds it was exactly 40% I could tell yeah and and I told them the remedy for this is

31:50.720 --> 31:56.480
they need better friends 100% no no some people that are their friends I know that they like you

31:56.480 --> 32:00.800
but the fact that no one's like calling you I've had you uploading that and just roasting the hell

32:00.800 --> 32:06.160
I mean go like dude this isn't the best you could do like and it's not a knock on you guys it's

32:06.160 --> 32:09.840
actually them like someone should say like hey you guys are too smart for this like you're

32:09.840 --> 32:13.280
better than this you can make a video better than this which is what you should do yeah and I

32:13.280 --> 32:17.520
think that that is what I was going to bring up if you have their phone number call them say that

32:17.520 --> 32:22.560
call us right now you watch a video and it's not I don't want to swear too much freaking perfect

32:22.560 --> 32:27.200
yeah call them and say hey this is garbage here's why fix it you can also DM us so that's

32:27.200 --> 32:31.920
our friend yeah if you are if you're watching that's on you that's not on us you're like even like

32:31.920 --> 32:37.200
my FBI video like you know that my team is working on that for months and I'm whatever we probably

32:37.200 --> 32:41.440
spent over half a million dollars between everything and I upload and I'm like this is like a

32:41.440 --> 32:45.840
perfect video it's so good we're so perfected and then you know I have like two or three people

32:45.840 --> 32:50.560
that call me they just shit on it and I'm like all that kind of hurt my feelings like but he's

32:50.560 --> 32:54.560
right you know like this part was a little fake there seemed as a little drawn out could have done

32:54.560 --> 32:59.680
this a little bit better um and it's like that's what you need no matter you there's no such thing

32:59.680 --> 33:03.840
as a perfect video like someone should always call you and shit on your video because it could be

33:03.840 --> 33:09.120
better like that's because imagine if someone does it every video and you upload hundreds if not

33:09.120 --> 33:13.600
a thousand videos over the next 10 years and every single time someone's critiquing you and you're

33:13.600 --> 33:18.240
applying what they're critiquing like imagine the compound effect over that time span it's it's

33:18.240 --> 33:22.560
invaluable but if you upload a hundred videos and very few people are shitting on them then like

33:22.560 --> 33:27.120
you just lost so much compound effect something you told us yesterday is that we need to have a checklist

33:27.680 --> 33:32.640
of all the things they need to be checked off because I talked to him quite frequently that's true

33:32.640 --> 33:37.200
and every time I give him the same advice and he'll apply some of it and then he'll like revert back

33:37.200 --> 33:42.240
and I'm like god dang it would have all the checklist so I can tell you the things to do and then

33:42.240 --> 33:46.240
going forward just check them out for you upload a video so you do yeah we talked about that

33:46.240 --> 33:50.880
today because one thing that we realized was everyone on your team also is holding you accountable

33:50.880 --> 33:54.160
for some of those checks that's items and that's when we're like oh we need our team to hold

33:54.160 --> 33:57.920
us accountable because sometimes I'm like no that doesn't actually matter like that would be

33:57.920 --> 34:02.720
an extra two hours of work yeah they're like yeah that would help retention yeah they're like who the

34:02.720 --> 34:06.720
fuck are you you don't want the perfect video I'm like you're right you're right let's do it that

34:06.720 --> 34:10.560
was the thing that I think I was so excited about in those creative meetings was everyone was on

34:10.560 --> 34:14.720
the same page like it wasn't just like hey whatever Jimmy says exactly and I thought that was

34:14.720 --> 34:18.880
really cool because I'm not an omnipotent being like I need push back I need people to like there

34:18.880 --> 34:23.920
are people have better ideas than me you know like the one the OP things about hiring people is like

34:23.920 --> 34:28.560
you know if you're editing a video you can probably only devote 20% of your time to it or whatever

34:28.560 --> 34:34.960
30% 40% if someone else is adding it and that's their job they can dedicate 100% of their work time

34:34.960 --> 34:39.920
to it right so since they have three times the amount of time to edit that video they should be able

34:39.920 --> 34:44.000
to edit it better than you even if it's only 20% better because they have more time same with like

34:44.000 --> 34:49.840
thinking creatively or like building sets or doing anything like you you have like as YouTubers

34:49.840 --> 34:53.600
especially people who build side businesses and have side channels there's like 50 things that

34:53.600 --> 34:57.280
need to be done and if you split your time amongst it they're all only getting a few percentage of

34:57.280 --> 35:01.120
your time so like someone should be able to do that job better than you because they're giving

35:01.120 --> 35:06.640
you 100% of their time and that's like the O.P. part about hiring people which is obvious you know

35:06.640 --> 35:10.800
yeah so when you first started hiring people it sounds like you hired people for the execution right

35:10.800 --> 35:14.960
like I filmed a video I needed edited so I can move on to the next thing yeah well that or and then

35:14.960 --> 35:20.320
I was like I don't like moving boxes yeah but I need like some I need this to move from here to here

35:20.320 --> 35:24.800
yeah like one of our first people is literally just like he just did grow where he just move boxes

35:24.800 --> 35:30.240
he was happiest yeah pick up box move it or I need this thing or whatever yeah when did you then

35:30.240 --> 35:35.760
start hiring people for to look forward to other videos right so not just stuff that you've

35:35.760 --> 35:40.880
shot and needs to get done or production slow progress slow I mean yeah because I'm I'm sure like

35:41.520 --> 35:44.960
just three years ago we probably like came up with what we're going to film like the week before

35:44.960 --> 35:49.600
you know like yeah like planning months ahead and like working on because you know like if I'm

35:49.600 --> 35:53.760
bearing myself alive I can't do that next week right or I could now because I've done it but

35:53.760 --> 35:57.440
when we first came up with the idea like that's something that takes like a hundred days like you

35:57.440 --> 36:01.280
got to build the coffee and you got a period for 10 days to make sure it works you got to you know

36:01.280 --> 36:06.000
figure out how to get air into it in the medic and all that type of stuff then make the area look

36:06.080 --> 36:11.600
nice so it's pretty on film and figure out lighting that it uh so um it's just like the videos

36:11.600 --> 36:17.200
just slowly got more more complex and obviously I just had to bring people on to figure it out

36:17.200 --> 36:20.720
how far in advance are you planning a do you know tree

36:22.240 --> 36:27.040
just how far out it's the calendar isn't it three months yeah right now it's not too far out

36:27.040 --> 36:31.520
three to four months so yesterday though we went to three creative meetings back to back

36:31.680 --> 36:35.760
about three videos that are pretty much immediately in production yeah right we're going to

36:35.760 --> 36:40.080
spend or I'm going to spend a hundred hours alone on island it might change I might push the

36:40.080 --> 36:45.520
out that's right now that one it sounds crazy yeah from the creative meeting we were and then

36:45.520 --> 36:49.440
a different video for half a million dollars that I don't want to spoil and what's what was the

36:49.440 --> 36:53.520
third one we talked about it's uh the escape room oh yeah and then I'm going to attempt the world's

36:53.520 --> 36:57.840
hardest escape room yeah and that one that's the one specifically where we were like oh because

36:57.840 --> 37:01.600
it's the world's hardest escape room each room is part of the story so each room needs to be

37:01.600 --> 37:06.240
custom built exactly based on retention because like we scouted all the best escape rooms they're

37:06.240 --> 37:11.840
pretty terrible so we just decided build our own so we can make it epic and obviously since I'm

37:11.840 --> 37:16.720
building I'm not the one doing it but uh when you guys see the video it's well you guys know but

37:16.720 --> 37:20.880
it's a pretty cool twist when it comes to retention obviously there's things you can do in the first

37:20.880 --> 37:25.920
30 seconds the first minute yeah are there checklist items you have to get people to 10 minutes to

37:25.920 --> 37:31.760
15 to 20 yeah I mean it's very hard with a single storyline if you're doing like a double digit

37:31.760 --> 37:36.800
minute video to just have that one thing grip their entire tension throughout the whole video and

37:36.800 --> 37:41.440
pay off at the end um so typically if you're doing a longer video you should introduce like a side

37:41.440 --> 37:46.160
story and like re you should have some plan halfway through like to reengage them so they'll

37:46.160 --> 37:50.480
just get bored you know what I mean like if I just said like if I hand you a camera and I had a

37:50.480 --> 37:54.480
camera it's like okay if he tags me he gets a hundred grand and then I just run and that's it it's

37:54.480 --> 37:58.320
just me running through the woods and him just running through the woods after me you can't make a

37:58.320 --> 38:03.040
15 minute video out of it you know what I mean but if I do that and then like three minutes in I pull

38:03.040 --> 38:07.200
a lever and a bear comes out and starts chasing him and he has to get away from the bear I don't know

38:07.200 --> 38:11.680
obviously we wouldn't do this kill the bear and then he starts chasing me and then six minutes in

38:11.680 --> 38:15.840
I jump across the lake and as he goes to jump through I press a button that shoots him to the moon

38:15.840 --> 38:20.320
whatever you know what I mean like now of a sudden it's interesting and you're watching right and

38:20.320 --> 38:25.200
that's it right one is just a single story and it's boring the other has side stories that like

38:25.200 --> 38:30.000
reengaged people so that like introducing other narratives but actually you know how we were

38:30.000 --> 38:36.000
talking about Dylan earlier yeah he just said I'm getting close to 70% I'm almost a decent YouTuber

38:36.000 --> 38:42.160
he sent me a graph or his new video had a 65% retention oh wow I told him if he doesn't get 70%

38:42.160 --> 38:45.520
retention on a video then he didn't do something right well I don't even want to pull up our attention

38:45.920 --> 38:51.040
yeah 70% that's what you need if it's below that figure out how to get higher we're probably at

38:51.040 --> 38:56.560
like 40% right now so we got some work to just we were talking about a lot of times in our video

38:56.560 --> 39:00.080
we'll be like this video is about this this this and that and we were like well what if we actually

39:00.080 --> 39:04.560
held one back and at that four five or six minute part we're like and the one thing we didn't

39:04.560 --> 39:08.320
tell you yeah was this yeah and then also it like takes another direction but I also think the

39:08.320 --> 39:12.160
thing you said that I think it's important is that it's not always just a bear that you have to

39:12.160 --> 39:16.880
bring in as a dual narrative right it also could be like you mentioned the visuals right and a

39:16.880 --> 39:21.440
lot of our videos we have like really fast moving visuals custom animations that's what makes it

39:21.440 --> 39:27.280
interesting exactly the like if you're not a creator who's doing maybe bigger stunts or anything

39:27.280 --> 39:31.360
like that and you are explaining things your visuals can be as simple as an ant crawling on just

39:31.360 --> 39:35.600
getting a biting yeah like it doesn't have to be right or in the case that we were talking about

39:35.600 --> 39:40.800
some of these shorts creators are gaining massive viewership by making subway sandwiches or making

39:40.800 --> 39:46.240
ice cream and telling stories shut up and yell out and and Dylan LeMay they're like I mean 82

39:46.240 --> 39:50.320
million views making ice cream and telling a story yeah so it's like there you go that's visual

39:50.320 --> 39:53.520
it's interesting and there's another narrative where he's telling a different story about those

39:53.520 --> 39:57.440
yeah I mean it you could probably paint a bowling ball and people would find it entertaining like

39:57.440 --> 40:01.200
there's an audience for everything you got a good personality you're passionate and like you know

40:01.200 --> 40:04.960
you present it in a way where it's entertaining like people will watch it I'll watch anything at

40:04.960 --> 40:09.840
this point we're all messed up in the head one great example of adding other narratives is your

40:09.840 --> 40:14.640
reacts channel I think it's really interesting because you guys are I watched your parkour reaction

40:14.640 --> 40:20.800
yeah and you and Chris are reacting but at the same time Nolan is losing money when Chris says a

40:20.800 --> 40:25.040
word exactly he can't say and so it's like already I just said something that's multiple narratives

40:25.040 --> 40:28.800
that are happening at once that there's the visuals of the parkour which are already really

40:28.800 --> 40:33.840
interesting there's your reaction then there's Nolan losing money exactly and then the payoff at

40:33.840 --> 40:37.360
the end where you're like well how much does Nolan make exactly my favorite one is on the

40:37.360 --> 40:42.000
reaction channel we do this thing where it's the video it started the video it's Chris and his

40:42.000 --> 40:47.840
grandma and I go every time Chris laughs he lose $500 and then we kick his grandma out of the room

40:47.840 --> 40:52.320
and I show him a bunch of tic-tocks and then you know you watch to see how much his grandma makes

40:52.320 --> 40:58.560
is reacts your most profitable channel most profitable well it depends how you quantify that and

40:58.560 --> 41:05.360
percentage like expenses revenue or by total revenue it's expenses to revenue expenses then yeah

41:05.360 --> 41:09.360
reacts because it doesn't cost much and so anything we make off reacts it put in the main channel

41:09.360 --> 41:13.680
which is how we kind of got here because I got to point where the main channel would make

41:13.680 --> 41:17.440
hypothetically a few million dollars and it's been a few million dollars a month and I was like well

41:17.440 --> 41:21.680
how can I get more money to burn and so then we started gaming and then gaming started making money

41:21.680 --> 41:25.600
and I just take that money and the next month throw it on the main channel and I'll take oh this

41:25.600 --> 41:29.520
is working well and then we started reacts and now we just take a few hundred grand month from that

41:29.520 --> 41:34.080
we just throw it on the main channel and yeah and just like these things exist just the pump money

41:34.160 --> 41:39.440
into the main channel so pretty soon when this place is done everyone will be in here and

41:39.440 --> 41:44.400
everything will be in here not everything okay even this place like because we're working on

41:44.400 --> 41:48.400
many videos on the main channel at the same time we'll be able to cap out like two or three

41:48.400 --> 41:52.400
it's almost to have to use our other studios once like I told you before we're going to build an

41:52.400 --> 41:57.040
expansion of this out back and have basically two of these then we'll potentially be able to do

41:57.040 --> 42:00.800
them because like if we did world's arch six our world's hardest escape room I mean it's probably

42:00.800 --> 42:05.440
going to take up all this space behind us and then um you know if we did like would you rather

42:05.440 --> 42:08.320
start video would you rather have a Lamborghini or a house you know like and then we built sets

42:08.320 --> 42:12.160
and probably take up that side and then if the third video after that's like eating the world's

42:12.160 --> 42:16.320
largest slice of pizza well this place is full but at least like even just doing that though is

42:16.320 --> 42:21.360
revolutionary for us right but who will be here it will be now like creative accounting

42:21.360 --> 42:26.160
everything yeah exactly all the people that help me pull off these videos yeah it'll be beautiful

42:26.160 --> 42:32.160
what's the um I guess workplace culture that you hope to create when everyone's in the same place

42:32.160 --> 42:37.280
oh that's hard one I don't even know I just just want to make the best videos possible a culture

42:37.280 --> 42:42.800
that helps get that and I you know hopefully one day you know as we build up other companies and

42:42.800 --> 42:47.840
things go well like make tons of money and everyone who helps me get there I just want to make

42:47.840 --> 42:53.120
temperatures out to be honest yeah is there going to be a basketball court here yeah inside no

42:53.120 --> 42:59.520
out that problem I mean there's a who I have the boys that are here play basketball it's funny how

42:59.520 --> 43:04.000
did you meet um Tariq because he he grew up oh right that's a funny story Tariq come on in come

43:04.000 --> 43:11.600
come here so uh here you go this is my care about Tariq so Tariq walk away basically this this is

43:11.600 --> 43:18.960
before I had any employees I uh I was like I need I need people to help me with the like just do

43:18.960 --> 43:23.840
these you just need help and I don't know why am I like 19 year old peanut brain I was like

43:24.800 --> 43:29.920
or maybe I did have like two or three employees but I was like comedians are funny like

43:29.920 --> 43:34.560
comedians would probably be like they they'd probably be fun to work with they'd probably be very

43:34.560 --> 43:40.720
helpful maybe he'll make me funnier he'll rub off on me and so um I went to a comedy show and

43:40.720 --> 43:45.760
and Tariq was doing comedy and like a bunch of other people were doing comedy there and all the

43:45.760 --> 43:50.720
ones that made me laugh I just was like riding down a notepad and then after the comedy show I just

43:50.720 --> 43:55.520
walked backstage and they're just I walked up to people and I was like yo you're funny you want

43:55.520 --> 44:07.280
a job and yeah okay and I was like no look I'm not a YouTuber and um and then I just somehow

44:07.280 --> 44:10.960
managed to drag them to my house how many subscribers do you have at that time like a million yeah

44:11.040 --> 44:16.640
yeah like one whole one million and I so they came over you know we've I filmed a few videos with him

44:16.640 --> 44:23.600
and uh some of the other guys and then he was like oh I'm sorry I just got a job at the hospital

44:25.040 --> 44:32.400
and one month classic Tariq I got a hospital job been a month and I'm like Tariq be my camera

44:32.400 --> 44:36.400
and I swear to God I will like the channel will blow up we'll hit 10 million subscribers I'll make

44:36.480 --> 44:44.560
rich and he's yeah and he's like hospital and so then Tariq left for a year for him specifically

44:44.560 --> 44:50.240
this is his story and then a year later like you know um and this now I have quite a few employees

44:50.240 --> 44:55.440
for like six seven million subscribers Tariq no maybe not that high maybe like three or four

44:55.440 --> 45:01.680
and Tariq's like you know I hate working at the hospital and he's he's like I'm miserable and I'm

45:01.760 --> 45:06.240
like well you're a luck I still want you get your butt over here and then he started like he'd

45:06.240 --> 45:11.040
go to hospital and then work at night and I was like I'm all your time like quit and uh and you

45:11.040 --> 45:16.480
know his family wasn't the the keynest on that but I was like ah you'll be fine and there you are

45:16.480 --> 45:26.080
and here you are he was like editing in my attic and uh stuff like that yeah at the attic the yellow

45:26.080 --> 45:30.560
floor because this the studio is for filming and then there's just an attic and I was like all right

45:30.560 --> 45:35.040
we got out of it and we just installed ACN so how many years have you been here Tariq?

45:35.920 --> 45:40.320
coming up coming up on three so three years two and a half years now yeah I could have been

45:40.320 --> 45:44.480
three and a half what's what's your perspective of the difference between when you first started

45:44.480 --> 45:50.400
to being in a space like this oh man like just experience and seeing him grow too like I joined

45:50.400 --> 45:55.200
when Jimmy I think was 18 or 17 at the time so that was that was cooler just seeing

45:55.200 --> 45:59.360
well and I first reached out you I was 19 yeah yeah because three years ago I was 20 so that's

45:59.360 --> 46:04.400
why I first started yeah yeah and and just seeing him grow and seeing his motivation stay that

46:04.400 --> 46:10.080
motivated at least me personally did like pushing so many people when I brought him on back then

46:10.080 --> 46:14.320
they're like yeah I was like we're gonna be the biggest YouTube channel ever I was like I don't

46:14.320 --> 46:18.720
care I'll fucking die trying like I'm gonna obsess and grind and they're always like you know

46:18.720 --> 46:23.440
eventually you'll get burned out eventually he's gonna slow down he can't just grow like this forever

46:23.440 --> 46:28.560
I was like no and so there were a lot of good people back in the day but it's hard to like

46:29.360 --> 46:35.280
put you bet your entire life and everything on a 19 year old that yeah honestly it's socially

46:35.280 --> 46:42.800
on YouTube yeah on a YouTube and like yellow floor stupid warehouse just making shit up every day

46:42.800 --> 46:46.960
but I mean the only thing that's consistent is like I wake woke up every day and I grind and I

46:46.960 --> 46:51.760
obsess and I was like I'm gonna I'm gonna die trying like if we don't make it I'm gonna try

46:51.760 --> 46:57.440
until the day I just put this on record he would tell us we would be like the biggest in the world

46:57.520 --> 47:03.840
every week like every I would pull them in our little room and I remember because like even Chris

47:03.840 --> 47:07.440
like it's hard to get him to quit his job all these people they're like this is just a YouTube

47:07.440 --> 47:10.480
channel what if we were relevant in a year this is years ago and I have like one and two

47:10.480 --> 47:14.480
million subscribers I would always have to pull my few employees in a room right on a whiteboard

47:14.480 --> 47:18.800
I was like here's what everyone's doing here's what we will be doing okay we're gonna make this

47:18.800 --> 47:23.200
money I'm gonna spend it all I'm gonna work work work out then I'll be like I'm just

47:23.200 --> 47:26.720
circling through all things and I'm like and I'm concluding that we will have 10 million

47:26.720 --> 47:30.560
subscribers by the end of the year and this one we're like on two in January and everyone's like

47:30.560 --> 47:34.320
you're dumb like even I had friends with like three or four million subscribers and they're like

47:34.320 --> 47:38.080
you'd be lucky if you even got close to me by the end of the year and like now one year we went

47:38.080 --> 47:42.400
from two million to ten well actually it was like 12 million subscribers and everyone was just like

47:43.840 --> 47:47.360
and I like I was like drawing three year plans it's like this will be here this will be here

47:47.360 --> 47:50.720
and this will be here and like we killed all of them but even then like when I showed it to all the

47:50.720 --> 47:54.480
boys back then they're like no this is stupid like you're out of your mind like you know we're

47:54.480 --> 47:59.040
not going from two to ten to thirty and whatever and I'm like nope this is what we're doing we're

47:59.040 --> 48:05.600
gonna obsess obsess obsess no one get a life grind grind here's what we're doing and then it just

48:05.600 --> 48:10.560
it just happened I got one more question for Tariq so you said that you saw him and he was a

48:10.560 --> 48:14.000
comedian you thought that'd be fun to work with a comedian now Tariq is the one that helped us

48:14.000 --> 48:18.960
set up this entire set up there's more about cameras than most people I've met how did you know

48:18.960 --> 48:24.720
how to use a camera yeah so I I did cameras before I met Jimmy but then I saw like I told you

48:24.720 --> 48:29.680
the story I saw a video of him just on the road and I was like this is in my town like I have to

48:29.680 --> 48:34.800
meet him and so you know I reached out to him on Twitter and then you know from there he started

48:34.800 --> 48:38.880
coming to the comedy shows and then you know all that kind of tied together so yeah it was cool

48:38.880 --> 48:42.880
it was really cool I got lucky that I got a comedian that actually had experience right

48:42.880 --> 48:47.280
I just had never seen YouTube before because I mean I was like so dumb back then I was just like

48:47.280 --> 48:52.320
yo that joke oh it's funny about the dog you want to get a job you want to help me figure out

48:52.320 --> 48:57.840
how to bury myself alive because you're funny it does seem like the the thing that the X factor

48:57.840 --> 49:02.640
in your growth and it feels like the reason why it can continue is because the ideas and you you

49:02.640 --> 49:07.280
but it's because I'm obsessed and I'm crazy like I will spend every dollar back into the channel

49:07.280 --> 49:11.040
forever I don't care I just want to be the biggest but it seems like you have like a unlimited

49:11.040 --> 49:15.520
source of ideas somehow like every time you put out a new video even if it's a something similar

49:15.520 --> 49:20.400
to your other video it's something new yeah how do you keep new ideas coming like how is how I

49:20.400 --> 49:26.640
I feel like the ideas I have always been great even when I was like 17 and I like the videos like

49:26.640 --> 49:30.160
high me in five years like have you ever seen someone make a ton of accounts on YouTube even to

49:30.160 --> 49:35.120
this day no one's dumb like I don't know like back then I was I feel like they're pretty creative

49:35.120 --> 49:39.520
counting to a hundred thousand I don't know but it's still different and obviously now I have a

49:39.520 --> 49:46.960
lot more help you know come with ideas and stuff but it's just I like when I was younger I'm not

49:46.960 --> 49:51.280
as hard for because we got hundreds of ideas now you know but when I was younger like I would train

49:51.280 --> 49:55.440
myself like to lose the dream so like when I was dreaming like you do this thing where you like

49:55.440 --> 49:59.120
stare at your hand like 30 times a day and you do something and then like in your dream if you

49:59.120 --> 50:02.880
saw your hand you'd realize your dream you control what you're dream about and I tried to like

50:02.880 --> 50:06.400
strategically brainstorm ideas while I would sleep and like I'd wake up in the middle of night

50:06.480 --> 50:11.280
right down ideas were you successfully able to lose a dream oh okay I haven't done that stuff

50:11.280 --> 50:15.680
in years I'm not as hard for when it comes that stuff but yeah there are some points where I would

50:15.680 --> 50:21.200
like I would wake up and I'd have ideas and it was it took so long to yeah that's hard to do

50:21.200 --> 50:25.440
yeah you have to like actually work on I think part of the problem that are not problem but part

50:25.440 --> 50:29.600
of the advantage for me it's like all I did was obsess over it during the day and typically what

50:29.600 --> 50:33.280
you think about what you dream about yeah so even if I wasn't losing dreaming I was just dreaming

50:33.280 --> 50:37.920
about videos and filming and then I'd feel like oh this is cool and just wake up right down

50:37.920 --> 50:43.440
it's I had a problem man I would like only watch things that like inspired me so I would like

50:43.440 --> 50:48.160
try to watch a different show or different things or different genres for inspiration and I like

50:48.160 --> 50:52.400
I would I had what I would call like an info diet and I would always like try to add new things

50:52.400 --> 50:57.280
so I was so obsessed with how to because really like like if I tell you to come up with that idea

50:57.280 --> 51:01.440
you're just gonna yeah from whatever you're gonna be like Gatorade or water whatever right but

51:01.440 --> 51:05.360
no one knows what that is. They may not be here. They may be taking the labels off. I thought

51:05.360 --> 51:10.800
it was the rudest thing I've ever roasted for it but but if we like I've told you guys this story

51:10.800 --> 51:14.960
a million times but if I open a dictionary here and we just you know flip to random page and we

51:14.960 --> 51:22.000
pick a word and the words flowers right then we'll be like okay I bought a flower I I gave my

51:22.000 --> 51:25.600
girlfriend a flower I gave my girlfriend a hundred thousand flowers I gave my girlfriend a hundred

51:25.600 --> 51:31.040
thousand flowers on Valentine's Day right you just go like that I gave to wreak a hundred thousand

51:31.040 --> 51:34.800
flowers I put a hundred thousand flowers on them and you do that for a few minutes and then you just

51:34.800 --> 51:39.840
flip to a new page and you're like what's this word and you just like so you that's the like the

51:39.840 --> 51:44.640
slowest form of doing it and the worst way to do it but that's in taking inspiration getting

51:44.640 --> 51:49.280
inspired and seeing what comes out and it's really just doing that and the more effectively you can

51:49.280 --> 51:54.000
take an inspiration and see what happens in your brain the better ideas. I think what's interesting

51:54.000 --> 51:57.840
though is like obviously you call yourself obsessed yeah other people you said when you're

51:57.840 --> 52:02.320
younger called you imagine spending 10 years of your life only think about one thing every waking

52:02.320 --> 52:05.920
hour of the day you mentioned earlier that people were like you don't have a life right but we've

52:05.920 --> 52:10.400
been here we spent all day with you yesterday behind the scenes I feel like you do have a life like

52:10.400 --> 52:15.840
your life is YouTube yeah yeah you do have a life friends who were hanging out playing basketball

52:15.840 --> 52:20.800
yesterday exactly there's like a lot more happening that people probably don't understand because

52:20.800 --> 52:24.880
all they see is what happens within the box exactly well and that was one of those the slower days

52:24.880 --> 52:29.760
you know like typically it's a lot more extreme than yeah maybe that was an anomaly yeah exactly

52:29.760 --> 52:34.560
well Jimmy's clear the schedule because we were in town yeah come on it's America come to town

52:34.560 --> 52:41.280
exactly we had to make sure play basketball yeah yeah but um yeah it's the thing it's like you're

52:41.280 --> 52:45.520
an idiot until you're successful then you're smart whatever you know I mean so it's just at some

52:45.520 --> 52:49.680
point you crossed that tipping point and people go from judging you and being like you're too obsessed

52:49.680 --> 52:56.320
with your freak blah blah to like oh like whoa congrats like you hire people and provide jobs like

52:56.320 --> 53:01.600
you're cool good job you know yeah it's like kind of blurry where that line changes yeah that is

53:01.600 --> 53:07.280
really interesting did you like engage in your typical high school life I guess like prom and I

53:07.280 --> 53:12.640
don't know other stuff like that's none of that stuff I just I was so obsessed it I'm telling you

53:12.640 --> 53:17.120
it is unhealthy helps there's not a single person on the planet that's been more obsessed that

53:17.120 --> 53:21.920
the same time span as me because it's physically impossible yeah almost every hour of the day

53:21.920 --> 53:26.160
that's what I was doing in math class in English class in any class any time of the day I was thinking

53:26.160 --> 53:31.520
about YouTube not stop the last 10 years one of our first videos about you was during your sub

53:31.520 --> 53:36.480
to PewDiePie campaign and we're like we're like oh mr. Beast is kind of like the new PewDiePie

53:36.480 --> 53:40.240
and we were talking about it this morning and we were like that actually couldn't be further from

53:40.240 --> 53:44.480
the truth yeah the title is mr. Beast is the next PewDiePie yeah and we were like actually they are

53:44.480 --> 53:49.600
completely different but you the you guys did a video time yeah it wasn't exactly about how

53:49.600 --> 53:53.440
you were like PewDiePie I was just saying you are the next person to reach that interesting yeah

53:53.440 --> 53:58.480
I remember the the mr. Beast is the first YouTube billionaire and then our one before it one

53:58.480 --> 54:02.960
before it yeah you're we didn't interview for you oh yeah we just made a video I don't think I ever saw

54:02.960 --> 54:06.160
that one yeah it has of the videos we've done with you it has the least number

54:06.160 --> 54:10.560
yeah but it's the number one spot I think it's the number one spot at that time yeah

54:10.560 --> 54:13.920
oh really so we got a number one of that yeah the number one of the billionaire and then

54:13.920 --> 54:17.920
number one with the losing and then number one with this yo we're on a street so yeah we did

54:17.920 --> 54:22.400
that video but then we were thinking like wait that is really far from the truth because like

54:22.400 --> 54:26.960
PewDiePie is a completely different type of creator he's he's I mean I think he still creates

54:26.960 --> 54:31.920
in a really similar way that's when he first started out right yeah and you keep evolving and

54:31.920 --> 54:35.680
changing the way that you're creating you know just different people different aspirations

54:35.760 --> 54:41.200
so at the end of the day like with him what's admirable it's like 90% of creators like if they

54:41.200 --> 54:46.560
had that number one spot in that long they would have been such egotistical critics to like

54:46.560 --> 54:51.040
would have changed and you know he never wears designer clothes or flexes on people or looks down

54:51.040 --> 54:55.520
on people a lot of his friends with the people he has in his videos aren't like super clouded out

54:55.520 --> 54:59.440
you know I mean like that is that's the thing that I would take away with him like it's really

54:59.440 --> 55:04.000
respectful that like he really didn't change much you know yeah obviously you know more about

55:04.000 --> 55:08.640
YouTube than anyone and even following it for a really long time yeah when boxing came about was

55:08.640 --> 55:14.720
that unexpected for you well the thing with boxing is it's literally two people putting everything

55:14.720 --> 55:19.600
on the line right you cannot tell your meme you know I mean like you're risking your reputation

55:20.320 --> 55:25.440
your dignity all that so like it kind of is the perfect thing to like be a big spectacle and

55:25.440 --> 55:29.520
cause they're well to stop because if you get two Titans or two big you know names that a lot of

55:29.520 --> 55:34.000
people know of and they're both like hey we're willing to risk it all one of us is walking away

55:34.000 --> 55:40.160
with a fat L on our face you know like of course like it's the perfect formula to be a big spectacle

55:40.160 --> 55:45.120
are you as captivated as everyone else but I love it yeah I mean like you know I don't put a ton

55:45.120 --> 55:49.760
of thought into it but when they happen invite the boys over get some popcorn and joy some dude's

55:49.760 --> 55:54.800
getting punched I feel like it's fine I've bought every fight I find it to be so entertaining yeah

55:54.800 --> 55:58.480
you know I know you started when you came up with ideas you'd look at a dictionary and find a word

55:58.480 --> 56:02.480
yep uh you have people just throw things at you and then you try and come up with new ideas

56:02.480 --> 56:07.920
exactly when boxing obviously was taking place on youtube did it throw a wrench in your head at all

56:07.920 --> 56:12.160
of like oh well maybe since that's the ultimate spectacle maybe if I combine it with something else

56:12.160 --> 56:18.000
and do this or yeah the only problem with those is it's like so much time I got so much going on

56:18.000 --> 56:23.040
so many employees so much that depends on the channel like I just can't spend six months just

56:23.600 --> 56:28.240
you know training three times a day or two times a day so I mean tons of ideas popped my head

56:28.240 --> 56:32.320
but are they ever going to happen no because obviously I got to meet people that depend on me

56:32.320 --> 56:37.840
I've had people ask me to box and I'm like bro if I just spend the next six months training like

56:37.840 --> 56:42.400
people lose their job but I don't care to do that do you think there's another sport that has

56:42.400 --> 56:46.400
that much tension in it that that youtubers could do yeah I mean every sport is

56:46.400 --> 56:51.120
I'm in did with the soccer well my space well I think baseball there's too much delay

56:51.120 --> 56:56.240
between action that that one ever pop but basketball would be phenomenal soccer boxing I think

56:56.240 --> 57:00.480
we'll always be at the top because it's just like it's two people putting everything on the line

57:00.480 --> 57:05.280
I don't think it gets much better than that to be honest yeah I really doesn't and and I just

57:05.280 --> 57:09.440
feel like the tension that when you put two unexpected people together like I thought that the

57:09.440 --> 57:13.680
social gloves event was the most interesting out of all of them you know what's fascinating is

57:13.680 --> 57:18.160
I talked to other people who aren't as like into social media as we are and they're just like

57:18.160 --> 57:22.720
who are these people I don't care yeah I guess that's true I guess you have to know who the people

57:22.720 --> 57:27.600
exactly we're just so entertained by two talking YouTube that we know all these smaller people

57:27.600 --> 57:31.840
that know all of them but you know you've kind of heard of them but um and you're just like wait what's

57:31.840 --> 57:35.440
gonna I mean okay so let's go to Logan Floyd it's just like what the hell is gonna happen this

57:35.440 --> 57:38.880
guy's bigger than that guy but that guy's more experienced than this guy so that's the going

57:38.880 --> 57:42.960
the questions are just so but all the boxes on the undercard like you weren't glued to the screen

57:42.960 --> 57:48.480
you didn't know exactly exactly how you felt on those is how everyone felt on the social club one

57:48.560 --> 57:53.520
that aren't like super into social media there's if you don't know and you've never heard of

57:53.520 --> 57:56.960
them it's like why don't I care yeah that's why not just watch professional boxes you know

57:57.840 --> 58:01.440
do you do that a lot where I feel like you do it sometimes in your videos where you build some

58:01.440 --> 58:06.400
of the backstory of the person before they win a little bit that's one of the critiques I get

58:06.400 --> 58:12.400
that I could do better yeah it's so hard to like get people attached to someone while also like

58:12.400 --> 58:16.400
keeping retention and keeping the tension and stuff like that that's one thing I got to learn

58:16.640 --> 58:22.080
a lot on it's like how to how to let someone tell their backstory in a way where I don't lose viewers

58:22.080 --> 58:25.920
I do feel like that's something that TV does really well they tell they tell back story but that

58:25.920 --> 58:30.480
also to me 90% of times boring right but if there's a way to do it in a condensed fashion where

58:30.480 --> 58:34.160
then the viewer all of a sudden cares about this person and if they win or lose then it creates

58:34.160 --> 58:38.560
a whole different you know yeah even then like take any TV show that does that upload to you

58:38.560 --> 58:44.800
to see their retention graph of that's ps4 so what entertains mr beast like what else are you

58:44.800 --> 58:51.360
entertained by oh boy that's definitely changed over the years I mean I watched a ton of anime I

58:51.360 --> 58:56.960
love anime it's like it's so creative and different and I feel like that inspires me so number one's

58:56.960 --> 59:02.160
anime and then number two is like I just try to watch a bunch of different stuff so I'm just always

59:02.160 --> 59:06.880
learning because you know you you can never learn enough and like there could be just one simple

59:06.880 --> 59:10.880
thing you learn through watching like an educational video that just like changes how you think and

59:11.280 --> 59:15.040
like allows you to just make better decisions for the rest of your life what was the first video you

59:15.040 --> 59:20.640
filmed in here uh that I don't know I don't know when you're gonna upload this when does that one

59:20.640 --> 59:24.800
come out probably a while because there's I'll tell you this there's 50 cameras used and there's

59:24.800 --> 59:29.360
a hundred people we'll put it there when you see that video you'll know and could that video have

59:29.360 --> 59:34.400
been shot in one of your other spaces or no no no there's uh this this place has like eight

59:34.400 --> 59:39.280
different AC units because it gets like so hot and so this is the only building we can keep cool

59:39.280 --> 59:43.920
and it rained three different times when we're filming and here we got like padded roofs and

59:43.920 --> 59:47.440
especially designed to cancel out the rain noise but all our other places you just hear like

59:48.400 --> 59:52.800
all the time and you can't film during that and um just everything about this place was perfect

59:52.800 --> 59:58.080
for like a long 10-day shoot so you started investing into like you know you got that space with

59:58.080 --> 01:00:02.720
the yellow floor and then you got well I started with an office right the office then yellow floor

01:00:02.720 --> 01:00:06.960
space yeah so was the the first space was the office building what we saw with no small oh small

01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:11.200
there's the one she said those two buildings over oh right okay so so you had office building

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:14.400
in that studio in the next studio in the next studio in next studio and now you know you have all

01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:21.200
these different studios like what um this investment is really significant yeah I think I walked

01:00:21.200 --> 01:00:26.160
into a spider web walking in here and I don't think I got it sorry you're like this investment's

01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:32.800
big I'm like I got a spider web it's a good moment for retention right yeah it is good uh this

01:00:32.800 --> 01:00:38.000
is a really significant investment and then additionally the you know when we sat with your mom

01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:44.800
and looked at your financials yeah every video is a really significant investment I don't think I

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:47.680
said this to you when we got out of there I was like I don't think there's no way there's someone

01:00:47.680 --> 01:00:52.400
else spending that kind of money on YouTube videos right no no there can't be no I would be best

01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:58.080
friends with them yeah you don't teach me I think the from you know you spending the most to

01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.640
the even the next person it's probably a pretty serious gap well and on top of that with how

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:06.560
frequently we're uploading to I mean yeah most videos are over probably like half a million dollars

01:01:06.560 --> 01:01:11.440
at this point so does your mom have the same because she kind of looks over that part of the

01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:16.560
business like did she have the same relationship to money that you have of like hey let's just

01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:21.840
reinvest it she's just gotten to the point where she like just accepts it like I mean we've ran

01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:25.840
out of money many times and had to get a loan to keep going or whatever but she just knows I'm

01:01:25.840 --> 01:01:30.960
not gonna stop so years ago she just gave that up she just gave it up he's yeah what and obviously

01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:35.680
now that we're this big like there's not as much to worry about but yeah I mean like I'd make

01:01:35.680 --> 01:01:40.560
50 grand a month and then I'd film a $50,000 video that I didn't have costing $60,000 and

01:01:40.560 --> 01:01:45.200
oh we're $10,000 negative and then yeah she'll be like okay once we make this back and we're in

01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:49.840
you know green like let's let's put some money aside and think nah let's keep going we made

01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:55.280
$60,000 this month it's on an uptrend and just keep going one thing that was really interesting

01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.680
is we talked about that video you pretty she literally printed out the financial statements

01:01:59.680 --> 01:02:03.680
for certain videos and one of the videos was where you were giving away houses and that obviously

01:02:03.680 --> 01:02:07.760
cost you know we've been just shy of a million dollars just shy of a million dollars and you

01:02:07.760 --> 01:02:12.240
told us how much you that video made and on add to it how much did that video make on that sense

01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:17.440
$10,000,000 less than half a million dollars I'll tell you that yeah so less than half a million

01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:21.920
dollars on something cost and then there's a brand deal on it but even that yeah after everything

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:26.000
said and done because that's not including the cost of the people to produce and stuff of that

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:30.560
so it was closer to like 1.3 million to do the video we're definitely not going to make

01:02:30.560 --> 01:02:35.520
over a million dollars on that video so how does this place how does this investment of

01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:41.280
$10,000,000 plus dollars how does it become profitable I don't know I just want to make the best video

01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:46.240
possible I don't know I'm not a businessman I'm a creator I just I want to make the best

01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:49.920
deals possible this helps and I believe as long as we're doing everything in our power to make

01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:55.040
the best videos possible people watch them and I don't know I'm a lunatic I think we'll work out

01:02:55.040 --> 01:03:02.160
it's a lot of faith in YouTube I've been doing it for 10 years now I'm not losing faith now

01:03:03.200 --> 01:03:07.200
I think YouTube is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger it comes installed on every

01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:12.960
Android device which is like 85% of all operating systems and 90% of searches in the western

01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:17.760
Google which YouTube pops up on I think you know like I've told you guys a little times gaming

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:21.040
viewership in the last two years is doubled like you can throw up the tweet the reports like

01:03:21.040 --> 01:03:25.920
that's factual in the last two years and two years ago gaming was freaking huge and it's doubled

01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:31.040
I think YouTube in 10 years is going to be bigger than we all imagine I have no freaking down my mind

01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:38.240
so you're expanding digitally now across the world you're also expanding physically with Mr. Beast Burger

01:03:38.240 --> 01:03:42.560
oh so dude it's so funny because we got so much stuff going on I'm like oh that's kind of

01:03:42.560 --> 01:03:46.080
everything yeah and they're like oh yeah that's right we have Mr. Beast Burger

01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:49.360
I was sitting here earlier before we started recording and I got a notification on my watch

01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:53.920
that was like hey here's a promo for Beast Burger was it at 4 p.m. yes oh perfect yeah that's

01:03:53.920 --> 01:03:57.440
what's when we sent out the notifications today because that's about it's the perfect time where

01:03:57.440 --> 01:04:01.520
if you're ordering lunch around like five or six like it's a reminder but I was just like dinner sorry

01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:05.120
did you say ordering oh okay I was about to say you say you say ordering I was like what time do

01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:10.640
you eat lunch yeah so like the conversions best yeah and it's also like by tweet about it or

01:04:10.640 --> 01:04:14.720
do a post like yeah I had to start I'm an idiot I don't know I never ran a restaurant like

01:04:14.720 --> 01:04:19.120
sometimes I do like a swipe up at like 10 p.m. from Beast Burger right right most the restaurants

01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:23.520
are closed right then one day I was like man these swipes aren't really doing much and then I

01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:27.840
realized I'm doing it whenever all our restaurants are closed and I started doing it like 4 p.m.

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:35.520
and I'm like oh I'm an idiot Beast Burger obviously that's everywhere in the US yep over a thousand

01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:40.880
locations over a thousand locations the fries are amazing every time I talk to them I love the

01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:47.920
fries did you know your fries are really good fries are really good talk to me about when does

01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:52.000
Beast Burger become a physical place I can walk into well what's what we were talking about before

01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:55.840
the podcast we're working on breaking ground in our first place our first physical restaurant I

01:04:55.840 --> 01:05:00.800
won't spoil where okay but yeah we got the first one in progress and eventually I want to

01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:05.920
scale up and do other ones I got some fun I don't know if it's possible like I'm gonna say

01:05:05.920 --> 01:05:09.520
stuff it might not be doable so if this isn't what ends up happening like it's not on me I'm

01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.240
gonna push the boundaries but I would love to what's also different because the COVID world but

01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:18.480
I you know how like McDonald's you just always have the slides behind yeah yeah yeah I want those

01:05:18.480 --> 01:05:22.720
back I will put those at Beast Burger locations I want to and now the other stuff I'm not gonna

01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:26.240
say because if I don't do it then people are going to be like you should do this but I have a bunch

01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:32.240
of ideas like modernize the restaurant um but maybe there's a reason restaurants so we'll see

01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.960
as uh we're designing the first one currently have you thought about how you keep customers

01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:41.200
coming back like is there a retention strategy at the restaurant yeah uh well hopefully it's just

01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:46.800
the food's amazing you know what I mean um and I I mean everything I who have obviously I

01:05:46.800 --> 01:05:50.480
think I'm I'm waking up but I'm obsessing over how to make the best YouTube videos possible so

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:54.800
as we build out the Beast Burger team like whoever it is like yeah I don't I don't want people to have

01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:59.120
to wait in a line at a fast food I don't want to like whatever other people are doing I don't

01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.920
care I want to be a modern restaurant that just it's on everyone somehow I don't know how I don't

01:06:03.920 --> 01:06:08.240
care I don't care if it makes money just I want the best experience possible yeah that's going

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:13.360
to be really cool because you think about those as like sets for your no I think it's just a

01:06:13.360 --> 01:06:19.600
independent business like it's uh I mean Beast Burger has a kind of good ring to it like five guys

01:06:19.600 --> 01:06:23.600
like yeah yeah yeah five guys didn't exist and I was like hey I'm gonna go start a company name five

01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.920
guys you'd be like I mean that's not that crazy I mean I'm like I like the name Beast Burger I think

01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:32.480
the the menus phenomenal like I think it has a chance like independent images to grow you know

01:06:32.480 --> 01:06:38.480
me like if five guys can be successful like why can't Beast Burger you know especially for obsessed

01:06:38.480 --> 01:06:42.320
innovating and adapting and just re-investing everything just literally what I did on YouTube

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.880
I want to do with the restaurant like it makes money it's profitable and I'm just like yeah just

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:52.560
keep it like grow grow like don't give me the money you know it's not keep growing eventually take

01:06:52.560 --> 01:06:56.480
the money put it into the main channel uh with that one I just wanted to keep just

01:06:56.480 --> 01:07:01.600
re-investing and just growing and growing and oh go build another restaurant go do whatever you know

01:07:01.600 --> 01:07:06.480
which business outside of the main channel and and YouTube are you most excited about

01:07:06.480 --> 01:07:11.200
that you're involved in? No I mean at the end I would give it all up for the main channel

01:07:11.200 --> 01:07:14.720
that I just want to be the biggest YouTuber I could possibly be and make the best videos possible

01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:19.680
that you got to have laser-like focus if you lose focus and you get too scattered brand then you

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:24.080
just like that's how you just fall off or like we see a lot of creators they start doing too

01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.400
many things and then like their content fades and what got them where they was isn't there anymore

01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:33.040
and when the channel dies so do all those businesses and stuff like that like yeah laser-like focus

01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:36.240
I just want to be the best YouTuber I can. Why do you want to be the best YouTuber? I don't

01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:40.400
fucking know you know I just ever since I was 13 I just made the decision I was going to be

01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:45.040
YouTuber I was going to die trying sounds different hearing me say now but I had that type of like

01:07:45.040 --> 01:07:50.160
devotion when I was younger like even when people would tell me it's crazy when ever no odds

01:07:50.160 --> 01:07:54.880
in my favor with no equipment no nothing no social skills no editing no camera no one to teach me

01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:59.600
no one to help me I just like I don't care I'm gonna figure it out I'm gonna die trying and I like

01:07:59.600 --> 01:08:04.560
even in high school like you know when I'm 17 and not making any money well I'm making money off

01:08:04.560 --> 01:08:09.520
YouTube like a hundred bucks a month but nothing crazy and I have horrible grades and like you know

01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:13.200
people are like okay well you're gonna do after high school and I'm like I'm a video YouTuber

01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:17.120
and they'd be like how and I'd be like I don't know but I want to make it happen and it's like

01:08:17.120 --> 01:08:22.160
I just it's just I feel like it was programmed in me that sounds weird but I just feel like

01:08:22.160 --> 01:08:27.200
I just have DNA that just like you're gonna be a YouTuber like not and since I was destined to make

01:08:27.200 --> 01:08:31.200
it but that like that's just how my brain has been like I'm gonna be a YouTuber or I'm gonna be

01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.640
80 with a thousand subscribers like there's no world where I wasn't a YouTuber in my future like

01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:40.800
that was it people thought it was crazy it didn't make sense it didn't make sense to me that I was

01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:44.560
like I'm gonna be a YouTuber and people be like I don't know I'm gonna be one I'm just gonna

01:08:44.560 --> 01:08:49.760
figure it out I don't care like if I never made it you know and I only had five thousand subscribers

01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:53.440
I would probably be working at McDonald's still just grinding YouTube every hour I'm not working

01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:58.560
and like just going hard to fuck until I became a YouTuber do you ever entertain the possibility

01:08:58.560 --> 01:09:02.640
that one day you won't care about being the biggest YouTuber I guess that's not my main focus

01:09:02.640 --> 01:09:07.440
but the main goal as it should be is to make the best videos possible because if you're making

01:09:07.440 --> 01:09:10.560
the best videos possible you'll get all the things you want like if I want to go be spur or

01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.040
we'll make the best videos possible but I want to be the biggest YouTuber and make the best videos

01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:18.240
possible so that is what I guess I might have misspoke earlier that is what the laser focus should be

01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:24.400
making the best videos possible and 99% of what a creator once will happen if you do that and I mean

01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:28.640
I'm going on 10 years and I love them more than anything you took my channel away from me like

01:09:29.680 --> 01:09:33.840
I don't know what I would do yeah one thing I think I've learned about you just spending time with

01:09:33.840 --> 01:09:40.080
you here is that you love strategy I do you love strategy like first of all we went into Jimmy's

01:09:40.080 --> 01:09:46.480
kitchen and there's so many versions of Katan yeah I like Katan more than monopoly because monopoly

01:09:46.480 --> 01:09:52.400
which I was telling you guys is like very dice and lock face for Katan is so strategic and like

01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:56.400
data and stuff like that also if you ever play poker with Jimmy he's got a lot of strategies

01:09:56.640 --> 01:10:03.680
I love it he's got a lot of strategy and I had no strategy yeah then I think Jimmy was like you

01:10:03.680 --> 01:10:07.920
really need to be having strategy you shouldn't have done what you just did I was like three times

01:10:07.920 --> 01:10:13.280
in a row like every time like the flop would happen and he just fold I'd like at least act like

01:10:13.280 --> 01:10:20.720
yeah helping me have a better game against him what is uh what does Mr. Beast do for fun uh I don't

01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:24.480
if you're not making videos I mean in a perfect world I'd love to go hang out with Elon Musk or

01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:30.720
stuff like that yeah obviously that's not possible um it's like there's levels like if I had like

01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:34.000
the perfect front and group I'd go hang out with other entrepreneurs I'd go hang out with people

01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.400
and just like if right next door there's another youtuber I just walk over there and be like oh

01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:43.280
teach me something that at the end is what I love the most but whatever anime or stuff I try to

01:10:43.280 --> 01:10:48.080
just work as much as I can because I don't know I just enjoy it you know yeah is your dream that

01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:54.080
more um creators come here yeah I mean I'd even just be in friends with them like I call you like

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:59.360
at least once a week pretty religiously mom you know I have a rotation of that but I just I'd

01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:04.400
love to like revamp the list of people I call every week like I always just call people to people

01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:09.200
listening and just like be like you don't teach me something that's how you stay on on on your

01:11:09.200 --> 01:11:13.440
A game and you're always learning and I don't know I feel like it's just run dry like you know I

01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:19.280
I don't I haven't I haven't met like a new youtuber in like months that I'm like wow like

01:11:19.280 --> 01:11:22.640
this guy's a genius and I'm not saying there's not one I'm saying I haven't found that person like

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:27.920
I'm actively like right now like I would hire someone to just give like I'm pay serious money

01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:32.480
for someone just give me a list of like up-and-coming youtubers that I could like talk to on a weekly

01:11:32.480 --> 01:11:37.040
basis and just learn from you know what I mean yeah and I I don't know it used to be so abundant

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:41.680
before but you know I've talked to probably 500 youtubers at this point so I was like squeeze

01:11:41.680 --> 01:11:47.040
the list dry you know what I mean yeah but yeah that I would I would love more than anything just to

01:11:47.040 --> 01:11:50.800
talk to other support youtubers and learn from them even any theories as to why that is that it's

01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:55.360
run dry I don't know I mean you choose to be in the never more creators are coming up than ever

01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.920
so I don't know why I mean like you know obviously you got a rock and Tyler all the air on

01:11:59.920 --> 01:12:04.160
they come up and I'm sure there are tons of other people I don't know why I'm showing them to find

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:09.120
them I mean there's probably so many people that went from like whatever 100,000 subscribers to

01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:15.920
over a million in the last year probably 10,000 plus you know I mean yeah but I don't know where's

01:12:15.920 --> 01:12:19.680
the master list you know I mean someone give it to me you know well but the hardest thing is

01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.080
probably like 90% of them do it as a hobby which is nothing wrong with that but they're not like

01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:28.880
laser focused intense you know I mean not like probably 99% of all you know I mean like I need a

01:12:28.880 --> 01:12:33.200
list of that hundred that are like I'm living and breathing it and obsessed you know what what do

01:12:33.200 --> 01:12:38.000
you think that like the archetype is of someone who comes and either works with you or works for

01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:43.920
you here like what type of person yeah yeah um I mean the biggest thing is you got me interested

01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:48.720
in the YouTube space like even if you're like the best at logistics person in the world like if

01:12:48.720 --> 01:12:53.520
you don't love YouTube you're not you know you're not interested in learning about it you're probably

01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:57.920
not gonna have too much success because everything we do is from the standpoint of making the videos

01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:02.000
because it's possible so if you're not obsessed about that it doesn't matter if you can figure out

01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:07.520
how to get a truck on Mars you know I mean if you get it there and it's not positioned the right way

01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:10.960
or just have certain things inside of it that makes good content or dot it out whatever's best

01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:14.480
for content then it doesn't really do much for us you know what I mean and if someone wants to like

01:13:14.480 --> 01:13:17.920
let's say someone doesn't want to be a YouTuber but they'd love to work for a YouTuber like how do

01:13:17.920 --> 01:13:25.040
you learn to do that how do you how do you study that that's a hard thing that I mean for people

01:13:25.040 --> 01:13:28.640
we're interested I mean we just bring them down and just have a shout-out to us all our people

01:13:28.640 --> 01:13:36.160
and we just dump our brain in them but for people that don't have that opportunity I mean just study

01:13:36.320 --> 01:13:42.320
YouTube watch a ton of YouTube I mean on like people trash on internships and I don't we don't

01:13:42.320 --> 01:13:47.360
really do them but if if I wanted to learn how to be a YouTuber I would just find or an internship

01:13:47.360 --> 01:13:51.040
with a smart YouTuber and just be like yo you don't you have to pay me I'll work my butt off

01:13:51.040 --> 01:13:55.120
just let me learn you know just like just let me do this until I feel like I've learned

01:13:55.120 --> 01:13:59.760
enough and like you would learn so much from people doing that I actually think though that one

01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:03.520
thing that you can do because like you said everything relates back to the video every a lot of

01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:07.200
what you're talking about relates back to retention actually and like how to how to make someone

01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:11.200
what's the point of making a video if you don't watch it exactly so I feel like one strategy of

01:14:11.200 --> 01:14:15.520
studying when you say study YouTube is taking a YouTube video whether it's yours or another really

01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:19.200
popular video right we were talking about a box yesterday because that's the closest thing to

01:14:19.200 --> 01:14:24.480
what we're trying to do right is box and so I think one strategy is to take that video and actually

01:14:24.480 --> 01:14:29.040
take a note pad out and just write what's happening in the video exactly literally write down like

01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:32.480
the first 30 seconds what is happening and that's what I did with your FBI video because I was like

01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.560
okay let me just understand what was Jimmy talking about what's happening in this video

01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:41.200
and then when you write it down you're like wait a second 40 seconds has gone by this many scene

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:46.240
changes have happened how many was it like it doesn't it was at over 12 yeah yeah it was over 12

01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:54.240
scene changes there was introduction of new information at each maybe you know six seconds and

01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:59.440
you had added in a twist by 40 seconds where the telephone the telephone the entire time there's

01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:04.720
tension of him chasing me exactly so and the scene changes actually the first scene change where

01:15:04.720 --> 01:15:09.600
it's like a drone shot of you sprinting yeah it happens in like probably four seconds yeah right

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:14.560
and so then I was like wait a second okay so we now we we are going to do that exact thing we

01:15:14.560 --> 01:15:19.120
don't make videos like that but we have to in that amount of time have that much happen exactly

01:15:19.120 --> 01:15:25.440
so how do we do that and that I think just again you've you've called me for a year everyone knows

01:15:26.000 --> 01:15:30.000
you've called me once a week for a year but coming here every time dumb strontists do this which

01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.400
yeah as weird as it sounds that's usually what it takes like I coach the guy from like

01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:40.560
like I mean the guy who's been doing YouTube like six or seven years and like he was like making like

01:15:40.560 --> 01:15:44.560
whatever like $20,000 a month and I coached him up to the point where he's making like $250

01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:49.360
grand a month yeah and like by it it was like oh similar story to you like a constant year I mean

01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:54.160
just beating his head and be like no you didn't get to do this and he'd be like no like here's

01:15:54.160 --> 01:15:57.840
why do this this is this if you like that's wrong but whatever there comes a point where you can't

01:15:57.840 --> 01:16:02.960
like you can't force someone to do it so you just back up and and then eventually usually people

01:16:02.960 --> 01:16:06.960
like come around to and they try it and then they try a few things also easy to convince yourself

01:16:06.960 --> 01:16:12.560
that like you're not you don't make the type of content that could get that many views right but

01:16:12.560 --> 01:16:16.160
you guys should be getting in a pervert world like four or five million views a video right you

01:16:16.160 --> 01:16:20.480
should right like there's you guys are smart enough like if it's not then it just wasn't a good

01:16:20.480 --> 01:16:24.080
enough video in my opinion right I mean even the videos we did that are your most few videos

01:16:24.080 --> 01:16:28.880
could be way better right what do you think gets us to a million subscribers well subscribers

01:16:28.880 --> 01:16:34.080
is an arbitrary okay so million views no you should ask me what helps us make the best videos

01:16:34.080 --> 01:16:37.920
possible that's the only question you should ask me subscribers don't matter views don't matter

01:16:37.920 --> 01:16:43.280
I mean they do yeah but all that comes everything you want as a creator comes from making the best

01:16:43.280 --> 01:16:48.720
videos possible and thumbnails but it's easier to you know make thumbnails the video parts the hard

01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:52.480
part and that's the thing that you're known for no one's known for having no one's like the

01:16:52.480 --> 01:16:56.160
biggest YouTube in the world because they have the best thumbnails right it's also because they

01:16:56.160 --> 01:17:01.200
have great phenomenal content you know I mean like that that's the hard part that very people do

01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:06.160
well and that's what people remember you know I mean like you're gonna have some random dude when

01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:10.240
you're walking down the street a pair of skill like yo that's the guy with the great thumbnails you

01:17:10.240 --> 01:17:14.160
know they're gonna be like no that's the guy with the phenomenal videos that whatever you know

01:17:14.240 --> 01:17:18.960
held his breath for 40 minutes underwater or things like that so that's a tip for you guys but

01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:24.560
also you guys watching ask how can I make my videos better do that every single day for years

01:17:24.560 --> 01:17:29.200
and then you'll probably get views I feel a lot like if we put out a video and we're frantically

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:34.800
changing thumbnails afterwards we're already way too far gone like not that it doesn't help

01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:40.560
to change your packaging but I know when we have a really good video exactly like I know it's

01:17:40.560 --> 01:17:44.480
really good and that the title and the thumbnail if you upload a video and you're not like

01:17:46.080 --> 01:17:49.600
you're not like this is a banger this is gonna bang no doubt in my mind even though you're gonna

01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:53.200
be wrong nine percent of the time then it's not a good enough yeah you still have to have that

01:17:53.200 --> 01:17:57.040
feeling even if you should have spent more time like the audience tell you you're wrong don't put

01:17:57.040 --> 01:18:01.120
it out when you already know you're wrong exactly yeah yeah 100 percent how do you know when you're

01:18:01.120 --> 01:18:05.120
wrong how do you know because you have some videos you have enough it's 10 out 10 yeah and it

01:18:05.120 --> 01:18:08.800
did worse than you're the nine videos and it's like okay but you have videos you don't even upload

01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:13.760
sometimes definitely I mean you just the thing is like it's it's a lot harder for us because like

01:18:13.760 --> 01:18:18.400
what we're doing are big productions of those span of months things get distorted I visualize

01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:22.720
the giant amount of money and this and someone scooping it up in a tractor and then you do it and

01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.400
it's not as epic you're like oh this is kind of lame you know what I mean like um so it's just

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.400
I just watch it honestly and I just like if there's ever a moment where I'm even slightly bored

01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:36.160
I'm like cut it and if there's something where I'm not just like wow you know like the whole time

01:18:36.160 --> 01:18:40.240
then it's like don't upload it it's it's not good it doesn't weigh on you at all that you're like

01:18:40.240 --> 01:18:46.320
man but I've probably invested over a hundred videos in my life like completely filmed I've spent

01:18:46.320 --> 01:18:52.000
probably I don't even want to pull number on it but but ungodly amounts of money on on videos

01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:56.960
in real life that don't get uploaded I don't give a fuck best video possible or get it on my face

01:18:56.960 --> 01:19:02.320
I don't care what's the last video you did enough load uh well it might this one is kind of

01:19:02.320 --> 01:19:06.880
on the fence we're re-editing it but uh if you never see it then uh we did a video where we built

01:19:06.880 --> 01:19:12.400
like 10 sets and I built like 10 rep because of banks it was uh robbed this bank I'll give you

01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:18.000
a hundred thousand dollars and then so like bank vault number one the the boys had to break into

01:19:18.000 --> 01:19:22.000
the bank and whoever broke into the bank first got what was inside in the vaults empty and the

01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:26.000
and I'm like so this vaults empty and some of the other vaults empty but one of these vaults

01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:29.440
when you open it will get a hundred grand and so they had to break in so there's like they had

01:19:29.440 --> 01:19:33.760
to break into a bunch of banks and all them were empty and then after like nine ones the tenth one

01:19:33.760 --> 01:19:38.000
which they're like none of these banks have the money in they finally break in I think I don't

01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:41.520
want to spoke but one of the boys broke in and then they opened it and there's a hundred thousand

01:19:41.520 --> 01:19:46.240
dollars in cash it's like congratulations you robbed the correct bank and it's cool but the sets

01:19:46.240 --> 01:19:51.840
were a little bland and the bits weren't as funny um and you know I just I didn't think it was

01:19:51.840 --> 01:19:56.080
as good as it could be but hopefully on our we're like on our twelfth at it hopefully this one

01:19:56.080 --> 01:20:00.480
maybe fixes some of the problems I'm having what's the hardest video you've ever made whether it

01:20:00.480 --> 01:20:09.440
came out on the channel or not oh boy oh well let's see oh god Tariq you have any inspiration

01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:16.160
throughout me yeah I mean I'm team trees was I mean I enjoyed it but that was that was a ton man

01:20:16.160 --> 01:20:20.480
I mean me a marker overworked on that for like eight months leading up to it I don't want to

01:20:20.480 --> 01:20:27.040
overestimate maybe seven or six and I was like it started with me wanting to plant a million trees

01:20:27.040 --> 01:20:32.720
and I was reaching out to all these youtubers that you know do environmental stuff and the

01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:36.480
gist was just like you're crazy you're like this just isn't possible you just can't plant a

01:20:36.480 --> 01:20:40.960
million trees so like it takes like hours to plant like a hundred and they're like what are you

01:20:40.960 --> 01:20:45.920
thinking and then I'm like you know mark can you build me something to plant trees and like some

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:50.640
me and mark are like scheming how to plant a million trees and then I was closing it on 20 million

01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:55.360
subscribers and I like I did like this thing where I gave my three million subscriber pennies four

01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:59.680
million subscribers like popcorn five million blah blah and someone on reddit was like you should

01:20:59.680 --> 01:21:04.400
give your 20 million subscriber or for 20 million subscribers you should plant 20 million trees I was

01:21:04.400 --> 01:21:09.920
like mark I know a million is impossible but get this let's plant 20 million trees to celebrate me

01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:15.520
hitting 20 million subscribers and he's like you're a fucking idiot and I was like let's do it and

01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.040
then we're like you know as we ran down the rabbit hole we're like there's no world where we're

01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:23.440
doing this and they're like well what if we gather all our fans and we do like different events

01:21:23.440 --> 01:21:27.440
and plant them and then we're like nope that would still only plant like a hundred thousand like

01:21:27.440 --> 01:21:32.560
that that won't work and then we're like like okay well what if we pay people to do it and then

01:21:32.560 --> 01:21:38.400
or what if we do seed drives what what if we have our fans buy seeds we sell seeds at cost they buy

01:21:38.400 --> 01:21:42.000
they plant in their yard and then we do research for a month and we're like it's an it could be

01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:46.080
innovation species you could do more harm than good I don't know if I trust 14 year old Billy to

01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:51.040
understand whether or not they can plant that next to a pine tree so then we're like and we're going

01:21:51.040 --> 01:21:56.080
off for months on months we're just figuring out how the hell we plant 20 million trees every week

01:21:56.080 --> 01:22:01.440
we're having calls and then we we I don't remember how well we got connected with the Arbor Day

01:22:01.440 --> 01:22:05.520
Foundation and they've planted like I don't know the exact number but I know it's over a hundred

01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:11.280
million trees their experts like this is this is what they do and they're just like yeah we can

01:22:11.280 --> 01:22:15.920
plant a tree they told us their cost and we're like can you get it down to a dollar and they're

01:22:15.920 --> 01:22:20.240
like I mean yeah at scale we could we can plant a tree for a dollar and I was like boom there you

01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:25.360
go in the market we're like okay all we need is 20 million dollars and they can plant the 20 million

01:22:25.360 --> 01:22:29.440
trees for my 20 million subscribers I'm already past 20 million subscribers at this point but I'm

01:22:29.440 --> 01:22:34.720
like fuck it we're in too deep and then now it's like okay how do we get 20 million dollars so

01:22:34.720 --> 01:22:39.280
we can plant 20 million trees and then we it's just started figuring out slow again it's like

01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:42.720
there's so much stuff that never even made the internet like trick shot for trees we were

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:48.160
gonna try to make a viral TikTok trend and get it where like you did a trick shot and if you missed

01:22:48.160 --> 01:22:52.240
you had to donate 10 dollars to plant 10 trees and then you had to challenge someone else like

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:56.800
ripping off a less ice bucket challenge yeah and so we're developing this for like a month and

01:22:56.800 --> 01:23:01.360
then we're like literally like testing it and then like I'm shooting a trick shot donating trees

01:23:01.360 --> 01:23:05.440
I'm challenging people like in these fake videos and we're like roasting and we're like no this

01:23:05.440 --> 01:23:11.600
isn't gonna go viral like no no one cares right um and then we're just workshopping all this

01:23:11.600 --> 01:23:16.400
and then I don't know how we landed on it but then we're just like know what we're just gonna

01:23:16.400 --> 01:23:19.840
get our audience to donate and we're just gonna get every youtuber we know to make videos on it

01:23:19.840 --> 01:23:23.600
and we're gonna just magically pray we don't only raise five hundred thousand dollars and look

01:23:23.600 --> 01:23:28.960
like the biggest idiots on planet and so we somehow got a list uh it wasn't from youtubers like

01:23:28.960 --> 01:23:32.800
some company that does a lot of youtube data they sell to like media companies and they they just

01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:37.680
gave us a list of like all the biggest youtubers like on an excel sheet and me and mark just like

01:23:37.680 --> 01:23:41.920
it took forever man we're just going down the list and I'd be like do they follow you on twitter

01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:45.600
now do they follow me on twitter no do they follow and we check our instagram we'd find some way

01:23:45.600 --> 01:23:48.960
to reach out to that creator or someone who follows us that follows them we'd be like hey get us

01:23:48.960 --> 01:23:53.120
in contact and we'd be like hey doing this thing make a video about trees tell your fans every

01:23:53.120 --> 01:23:57.440
dollar they donate boom and we went down this list DMed over a thousand of the biggest creators

01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:01.680
got hundreds of them to make videos on it they all launched at the same time as our videos

01:24:01.760 --> 01:24:06.720
and like and yeah in the first day we raised millions of dollars and crushed our 20 million dollar

01:24:06.720 --> 01:24:12.560
goal the quote of the night is all we needed was 20 million dollars but that campaign that wasn't

01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:19.760
the problem that's it's wild man there's so many like literally it was six months to me just

01:24:19.760 --> 01:24:25.040
means and mark mark more so than me I'm of the kind of like oh let's do an h what marks like

01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.800
every other day we'd have mental breakdowns we're like we're not going to raise 20 million dollars

01:24:28.880 --> 01:24:32.960
what are we crazy like we should we should do two million dollars and I'd just be like

01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:37.680
nah let's do 20 million dollars I hit 20 million subscribers mark it's a funny story and then

01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:42.480
I would convince them I'd be like uh and also it's 20 million dollars by 2020 see it's a good slogan

01:24:42.480 --> 01:24:47.600
and he's like oh well if you put it that way I guess we'll just keep the unrealistic go I mean

01:24:47.600 --> 01:24:52.640
that was a big success that was that was huge success it is the biggest thing I've ever done yeah

01:24:52.640 --> 01:24:58.240
I mean literally not all 20 million have been planted I think like 13 12 13 someone there has

01:24:58.240 --> 01:25:02.160
been planted I think all of them all 20 million will be planted by the end of next year

01:25:02.160 --> 01:25:06.240
and yeah I think that's a really good example of like you make the best videos possible and then

01:25:06.240 --> 01:25:11.600
you can do anything like you do such interesting things like if you want to plant 20 million trees

01:25:11.600 --> 01:25:15.440
you could do that if you're making good videos yeah but like and the thing is like 99% of people

01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:20.880
even if you had that ideal like I mean that was so much time man so much times and so many like

01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.840
it started with a million and it's like a half a year of just non-stop obsession and grinding

01:25:25.840 --> 01:25:29.920
and reaching out and learning and learning and learning and trick shot for trees and this and

01:25:29.920 --> 01:25:34.880
that all just culminating to that final end point and like 99% of people would have gave up like

01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.680
they would have gone I want to plant a million trees and someone would have gone you could only

01:25:37.680 --> 01:25:44.800
plant a hundred and they would have been like oh whoa goes if you do it do you think attention

01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:49.280
is the most valuable currency in the world well of course I mean if you could post something

01:25:49.280 --> 01:25:53.920
in everyone in the world of watch it you'd be the most powerful man on earth so of course simple

01:25:53.920 --> 01:25:59.040
question yeah it's just curious if you had that opinion I do yeah yeah I have the same opinion

01:26:00.800 --> 01:26:04.800
that's where that conversation ends so then what you did with Mark was really successful do you

01:26:04.800 --> 01:26:09.920
have plans to do something different with him yeah so this year it's a few days after the two

01:26:09.920 --> 01:26:13.920
year anniversary of team trees were launching team sees I don't want to give away too many spoilers

01:26:13.920 --> 01:26:19.120
you know one dollar might get something out of the ocean we'll reveal it then but if you are

01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:23.520
creator which I know you guys have a lot of creators so watch you hit me up or Mark Rover team

01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:27.360
sees is happening this year we're gonna try to raise more than 20 million dollars which is

01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:33.520
terrifying I need your help I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it raise one dollar for every

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:40.240
grain of sand on the beach yeah sure yeah yeah that's the one team trees was definitely the biggest

01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:46.720
reaction that I remember yeah like just global headlines yeah everywhere Elon Musk donated a million

01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:50.800
dollars so we had this lead aboard the more you donate the higher up you got so like it would like

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:56.000
get like a ego match for people and like so like someone donate 100 grain it'd be number one

01:26:56.000 --> 01:27:00.640
and someone donated 101 and someone donated 200 and Elon Musk donated a million dollars to be

01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:06.000
number one which I thought was cool and then Toby from Shopify which I love shout out to you you're

01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:11.520
like super cool donated like a million and one dollars so he took the swap from Elon and just

01:27:11.520 --> 01:27:16.320
sat up there and I thought that was funny I yo Toby if you're watching this when tea sees happens

01:27:16.320 --> 01:27:21.280
DM me that'll be fun we expect over a million dollars we expect one million and two

01:27:21.280 --> 01:27:25.840
yeah I'm kidding even if you don't donate it just be cool to get your thoughts on it but over a

01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:32.000
million and two would be nice oh is that what we're doing just curious billionaires every billionaires

01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:40.240
we write if you don't donate I'm curious just if you in terms of YouTube like I'm really curious

01:27:40.240 --> 01:27:45.280
your perspective on the vlogging format like creators like Emma Chamberlain okay like how do you

01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:50.320
think that plays into the concept of like she I mean her viewership is really significant and

01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:54.800
sometimes she's just like at her house making coffee and making a peanut butter jelly sandwich

01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:59.760
sure like how do you think she captures that much attention well I mean it is entertaining she's

01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:06.640
an actually funny person and like that is a skill being like I I couldn't do that or if I did

01:28:06.640 --> 01:28:10.720
like it wouldn't be so off the cuff like she she's just an actually witty and funny person like

01:28:10.720 --> 01:28:14.960
Chris in my videos yeah one of the wittiest people I've ever met my life like you could just drop

01:28:14.960 --> 01:28:18.800
this gatorate bottle and he'd say something I just make you laugh like crazy and it's like how

01:28:18.800 --> 01:28:24.560
where did that come from right but at the same time you're limited by a personality like she's

01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:30.320
doing well she's you know top 1% of creators but I mean how many views a month like 40 or something

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:35.200
like it's great it's phenomenal but it's like there's she's tied down to a personality if you

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:39.120
don't like Emma then you're not gonna watch her videos you know what I mean and so there's only

01:28:39.120 --> 01:28:43.920
so big that can take you and even if you do get super big it's like literally just all on your

01:28:43.920 --> 01:28:48.240
shoulders it's a lot of weight and a lot of pressure so that is a lot of pressure because the

01:28:48.240 --> 01:28:51.920
product of the video is your personality well yeah because if you're depressed or you're going

01:28:51.920 --> 01:28:58.320
through stuff you know it's harder to make videos you know I mean but yeah at the same time like

01:28:58.320 --> 01:29:02.720
you know a lot of people just enjoy making that type of content so yeah that's true yeah I asked

01:29:02.720 --> 01:29:07.200
you yeah yesterday do you need to be in a good mood to film a video and you kind of say you

01:29:07.200 --> 01:29:12.080
you said like I don't really have a choice because if I don't then I just burned half a million

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:17.360
dollars yeah on some videos here but also your format lends itself that that you don't always have

01:29:17.360 --> 01:29:22.080
to be in a good mood because like it's the story work that went in beforehand that ensures

01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:27.280
the reaction whereas like for Emma she probably doesn't need to be in a good mood exactly like

01:29:27.280 --> 01:29:31.360
she does have to be in a good place for her personality it's like two drastically different creators

01:29:32.720 --> 01:29:37.360
yeah it's almost like do you try and take out a lot of those variables when you're planning a video

01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:41.680
I don't know I just do whatever I think we'll make the best video possible I mean I hate to

01:29:41.680 --> 01:29:45.360
always fall back on it but that that's that's the driver it's just whatever I think we'll make

01:29:45.360 --> 01:29:48.640
the best video possible like if I thought telling people more about myself or being more

01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:53.360
personal and make the video better I would do it but I think most people like for the most part

01:29:53.360 --> 01:29:57.920
like they want to see me run for an FBI agent they don't want Nick hear me go oh also guys

01:29:57.920 --> 01:30:02.240
tomorrow's my mom's birthday you know what I mean like they're there to see me run for an FBI

01:30:02.240 --> 01:30:07.600
agent you know what I mean so but we did tweet about the caller daddy's podcast yeah you replied

01:30:07.680 --> 01:30:11.680
to that tweet you said I'm starting a podcast yeah there was a lot of people who are excited about

01:30:11.680 --> 01:30:15.360
that we were like they people took it as a real headline yeah there was some people press out

01:30:15.360 --> 01:30:22.240
list that said Mr. Beast announced his podcast I mean I the only reason I would do a podcast is to

01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.280
make money to be able to do big YouTube videos so if I thought that I could make enough for

01:30:27.280 --> 01:30:31.840
and make a difference I'd be able to album my content 100% I'd do it it's just like that it's

01:30:31.840 --> 01:30:36.480
it's happy study big YouTubers it happens time and time and time again they like they get big they

01:30:36.480 --> 01:30:40.480
start side projects they lose focus their channel falls off and then all that stuff fades away

01:30:40.480 --> 01:30:44.880
with it you know what I mean you just you got to be focused at the end of the day that that's

01:30:44.880 --> 01:30:49.120
what matters main channel Mr. Beast on all this other stuff supports it you know what I mean

01:30:51.040 --> 01:30:56.400
right now when you download the YouTube app your picture is on there yeah yeah on the Google

01:30:56.400 --> 01:31:00.000
Play Store on the Google Play Store yeah so on the Google Play Store when you download YouTube your

01:31:00.000 --> 01:31:04.960
pictures on there yeah how much do you interact with YouTube do you give them advice on YouTube

01:31:05.040 --> 01:31:08.800
not really no do they reach out to you at all I mean at the end of the day like what am I gonna tell

01:31:08.800 --> 01:31:13.280
the there are me of a hundred people or a thousand people that work on this part of the thing

01:31:13.280 --> 01:31:18.080
that like yeah my five second thought of opinions better than their analysis you know I mean

01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:25.920
no I think they do a good job I think they they take responsibility um and I just it's crazy

01:31:25.920 --> 01:31:29.920
that you if you have a hundred subscribers you have five subscribers if you upload a good enough

01:31:30.000 --> 01:31:35.600
video it will get views like if you're not you're just I don't want to make such a definitive

01:31:36.160 --> 01:31:40.320
thing take this to the grandson I don't majority of the time you're just not making a good enough

01:31:40.320 --> 01:31:44.560
video if it's not getting views you know what I mean um if that's your goal to get views obviously

01:31:44.560 --> 01:31:48.720
if your goal is not to give views then who cares you know what I mean um but you can get a million

01:31:48.720 --> 01:31:53.120
views on a video even if you have a hundred subscribers if the views good enough you can promise

01:31:53.120 --> 01:31:59.280
I've seen it happen a bunch so next to YouTube right under it is there a platform that you like

01:31:59.280 --> 01:32:04.800
the most next to YouTube no I mean I I like them but it's YouTube YouTube it's what I live

01:32:04.800 --> 01:32:08.240
and breathe take them all away I don't care I just want YouTube YouTube is the future in my

01:32:08.240 --> 01:32:14.000
opinion of television it's the biggest it's it's not going anywhere it's the most dominant and

01:32:14.720 --> 01:32:18.080
I just I love YouTube more than anything why do you think it's so dominant like what makes you

01:32:18.080 --> 01:32:25.040
I told you like Android you know come on Android phones Google and it's just has such a deep

01:32:25.040 --> 01:32:30.160
catalog and there's so many people on it has the best monetization program like you know YouTube

01:32:30.160 --> 01:32:33.360
paid creators more than any other platform in history you know probably more than the other

01:32:33.360 --> 01:32:39.600
platforms combined you know what I mean and it's just I love it I love it so much I don't know

01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:45.040
I think the algorithm also promotes better storytelling like the barrier to entry of the title

01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.920
and the thumbnail if you actually back up that title and thumbnail it requires that you told

01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:54.640
a compelling story agree like when it comes down to retention if you actually keep someone from

01:32:54.640 --> 01:33:00.640
zero to 15 minutes you've done a good job of telling a story my my problem when I load up YouTube

01:33:00.640 --> 01:33:05.200
on my TV is that there's too many videos I want to watch it's gotten too good at recommending

01:33:05.200 --> 01:33:10.560
me videos that I see like four on the top row and like the top you know top half of like another four

01:33:10.560 --> 01:33:14.800
and I'm just like I want to watch all these what do I do what type of videos are those like

01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:22.960
what you know probably be like how US aircraft carrier gets food and our delivers mail you know

01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:27.680
air flight patterns of planes and then this one will be like how this random guy on reddit

01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.320
turned a thousand dollars into a million and and stuff like that you know and and then there's

01:33:32.320 --> 01:33:38.960
like the random like what Aristotle taught people in 10,000 years whatever go stuff like that

01:33:39.120 --> 01:33:44.320
um but yeah it's always like they're always so interesting and I know like like I'm going to watch

01:33:44.320 --> 01:33:47.920
most these videos because I've watched thousands of videos on my accounts so it's like it knows

01:33:48.080 --> 01:33:53.280
what I'm I'm going to watch and it's just like it's it's so hard at this point for me I don't

01:33:53.280 --> 01:33:56.240
know if other people have this problem like the algorithm's getting so good that I think they need

01:33:56.240 --> 01:34:01.760
to serve less videos because I don't I'd stress as me out I'm like like which one do I pick

01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:08.240
there I want to watch them all is there an analytic that you wish you had uh the I would love

01:34:08.240 --> 01:34:15.680
to be able to see what a bunch which one do I say that's horrible I would love a to be able to

01:34:15.680 --> 01:34:20.160
do ab testing thumbnails I think we all agree like that would only be second I'd love to see

01:34:20.880 --> 01:34:26.000
like if someone if someone watches selling houses for a dollar right they watch this video they watch

01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:30.400
all the way into the end and I would love to be able to see like if they win watch another video

01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:34.400
and another one right or a better example be like like it did last sleep circle for 10 grand

01:34:34.400 --> 01:34:38.640
right I'd love to be able to see okay well every well a lot of people who watch this when

01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:43.760
then win a watch like last sleep slime and then actually you can't see that I just wish I don't

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:48.080
know like which there's this an easier way to show it like follow because you're strong you mean

01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:52.720
well you can click on a video suggest and see which video suggest it I guess yeah I guess I'm

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:57.360
just too lazy to dig through that um it just be cool to be able to see the viewing patterns of

01:34:57.360 --> 01:35:01.200
first but the more I'm speaking at the more I'm realizing there'd probably be privacy concerns

01:35:01.200 --> 01:35:06.080
yeah if you could follow a user so yeah so now I'm gonna start back like maybe that is but you

01:35:06.080 --> 01:35:11.280
mean like an aggregate like if it said like but it does kind of show you that yes people from this

01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:16.080
video are coming to you this I'm an idiot and that just disregard everything I just said

01:35:16.080 --> 01:35:22.000
there the the more I think about the dumber that was so there was a couple things on your financial

01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:26.080
statements that I found really interesting yeah we're back yeah yeah just you loved the finance

01:35:26.080 --> 01:35:29.520
yeah I loved it that was my favorite they're fun to talk about because no one's ever seen them

01:35:29.520 --> 01:35:34.560
before yeah yeah so one of the the parts of your financial statement was also merchandise and I

01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:38.640
feel like it's not something we hear about that often with you unless it's like you're writing

01:35:38.640 --> 01:35:45.440
everyone's name yeah um how do you interact with that are you like does it interest you I

01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:51.200
saw that it's like available in retailers yeah we're in zoomies and that's going well I um I don't

01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:56.800
know I don't I I just like I'm so obsessed with like making the best feels possible that I just

01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:00.720
yeah I hate promoting merch and videos because it drives people off to sight which hurts

01:36:00.720 --> 01:36:04.560
retention and and you get promoted less and then if someone's going to watch that video in the

01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:08.320
next video will they watch this video you send them to buy merch they don't watch that next video

01:36:08.320 --> 01:36:12.800
all around it's so it's like I could make I mean ungodly amounts of money if I promote

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:16.480
and merch every video but I just don't want it I just want to make the best feels possible you know

01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:24.320
so um yeah it's it's yeah not what it could be basically fraction of what it could be if I should

01:36:24.320 --> 01:36:28.400
like most videos I don't even mention merch imagine if I promote and merch every single video

01:36:28.400 --> 01:36:33.040
you know what I mean like yeah I would sell a bunch but I don't know I just just want to make the

01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:37.600
best feels possible and I don't think promoting merch makes a video better but sometimes like

01:36:37.600 --> 01:36:41.200
but let me back put a little bit sometimes they do need to promote it because some videos cost

01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:47.520
over a million dollars and I don't do a million dollars per video and ad revenue so you know yeah

01:36:47.520 --> 01:36:52.240
all right so we did a YouTube money calculator to see how much money your channel has made

01:36:52.240 --> 01:36:58.880
in total and it's lifetime okay lifetime lifetime okay main channel okay yeah and so that's

01:36:58.880 --> 01:37:05.360
often 12 billion views 12 billion views okay so the number it gave us was 28 million dollars

01:37:05.360 --> 01:37:13.680
so it's assuming like a two point three dollar RPM interesting I mean obviously I've

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:18.880
spent tens of millions of dollars on my videos so the money has to come from somewhere I won't leave

01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:23.840
it at that you know what I mean okay yeah cuz you've spent more than that of course yeah I mean

01:37:24.560 --> 01:37:28.080
tens of millions of dollars have gone into my YouTube videos like because I've taken all the money

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.840
from the gaming channel the react channel all the other stuff I'm doing on my merch all the

01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:37.200
brand deals everything gone right back into it yeah I don't know I mean I mean there's probably

01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:43.600
gonna be a day where I'll spend over a billion dollars on just YouTube videos in the future that's

01:37:43.600 --> 01:37:49.120
so crazy obviously I'm nowhere near that but I'm talking like you know two decades from now or a decade

01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:54.240
yeah yeah but in a year you're spending lots more than I just said yeah yeah way more funny

01:37:55.200 --> 01:37:58.880
I mean like some months first paying like four or five million dollars on videos yeah yeah

01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:06.880
so crazy I saw it in the financial system yeah yeah that's so I try lighting a soccer field

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:12.160
or something right he kind of I'm renting an NFL stadium yeah or any of that type of stuff it's

01:38:12.160 --> 01:38:19.040
expensive but I don't own panels videos yeah as team guys I don't want to get into that man it just

01:38:19.040 --> 01:38:23.440
how many people work here I don't know the exact number you know because you know some people

01:38:23.440 --> 01:38:28.240
hire and I leave it a lot of yeah but I mean it's it's a lot obviously dozens of fun dozens of

01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:35.360
people I'll leave it open for interpretation you guys speculate yeah do you ever feel you talked

01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:39.760
about like people always suggested that maybe you would get burnt out on YouTube do you ever feel

01:38:39.760 --> 01:38:44.240
burnt out like other times or you feel like I think I tired my definition might be different than

01:38:44.240 --> 01:38:49.760
others you know like some people like I'm burnt out screw this I'm done I'm done I'm done you

01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:54.800
like never never at that point but yeah like if if I'm going like you know I go from time

01:38:54.800 --> 01:38:58.800
again to time I go to bed like three days in a row I'll be like okay like kind of want to like

01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:03.040
take half a day off and like chill or like I'll feel like coming and stuff like that but

01:39:03.680 --> 01:39:07.600
this is what I'm doing to the day I die I don't care like I love this more than anything nothing's

01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:12.720
ever brought me a fraction of the joy what are the in between moments like for you when you're like

01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:18.240
buried alive for 50 hours like the because we don't see all of it well you do in between these

01:39:18.240 --> 01:39:21.920
things we show time lapse so you could see I was in there the whole time but I mean yeah still

01:39:21.920 --> 01:39:28.480
you don't see a reaction I don't see if you're enjoying it in the middle of the point is to

01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:34.560
enjoy here let me just put this out there I did not enjoy being buried alive so we're all on the same

01:39:34.560 --> 01:39:42.800
page I my back hurt from laying on a wooden board for 50 hours the thing is like um you know

01:39:42.880 --> 01:39:47.440
sometimes I got a little claustrophobic and I'd be like oh god I like I can't stand up if I

01:39:47.440 --> 01:39:52.960
wanted to and but I'd just be like you know we did our research we tested it we buried the box

01:39:52.960 --> 01:39:58.160
for like you know what was it I tricked you know I don't care like five 10 days beforehand like

01:39:58.160 --> 01:40:02.480
we did extensive research so every time I'd be like oh god I can't move there's thousands of

01:40:02.480 --> 01:40:08.400
pounds of dirt on me I could die I'm like nope did the research trust math I'm not gonna die you know

01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:14.480
I had to just remind myself multiple times like nope you're good because like it's it's it was a

01:40:14.480 --> 01:40:18.880
see-through coffin so it's different than just a normal one every time I look up I just see

01:40:19.760 --> 01:40:25.040
dirt and it's like just the only thing stopping that dirt from just suffocating me and collapsing

01:40:25.040 --> 01:40:29.920
on me it's just this last like this thick you know and that's the only thing staying between me and

01:40:29.920 --> 01:40:34.480
whatever like eight feet of dirt so we were in one of your meetings yesterday and it's for

01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:39.680
when you are coming videos and they brought up that there are bow constrictors and that bow

01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:47.600
constrictors were a real threat yeah to this production to you and that you know while they're

01:40:47.600 --> 01:40:52.640
not poisonous yeah they can crush your body in a matter of you know minute yeah exactly so we'll

01:40:52.640 --> 01:40:58.160
keep the medic within a minute so these discussion was around where the medic should be so I

01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:02.560
how many medics we should have yeah we're putting on two medics stations so they're close enough

01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.840
that they can stop me from getting killed by a bow constrictor so have you developed an appetite

01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:15.040
for pain for for for managing fear and discomfort well I mean we just a strategic like we don't we

01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:18.480
don't ever do anything where I could die like bear it alive there was a zero percent chance to

01:41:18.480 --> 01:41:22.080
anything would happen to me like we did our research we've hired consultants we spent over a

01:41:22.080 --> 01:41:25.520
quarter a million dollars spending that company like there was no risk I was probably safer down

01:41:25.520 --> 01:41:29.280
there than I was up above the ground and like genuinely I mean that I was safer in that box

01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:33.120
than if driving the car home afterwards if you really think about it just like when they say

01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:38.960
you're safer in a plane than you are driving a car and so you know it's like we don't leave

01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:42.800
anything up to chance we're very tactical and we account for all that stuff but like opportunity

01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:48.240
to die is one thing that like just discomfort like feeling oh with this kind of feeling claustrophobic

01:41:48.240 --> 01:41:53.920
getting really really sunburned it's weird like like when I count to a hundred thousand or even

01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:59.120
before that cut a table and half of plastic knives which took god knows like the days

01:41:59.120 --> 01:42:05.120
I'm just sawing because I was in math class when I was in high school and I just like I'd

01:42:05.120 --> 01:42:09.600
plastic knife in my pocket from lunch I don't know why I put it there and I just like

01:42:09.600 --> 01:42:13.600
saw it a little bit I was like oh well you can cut a table and half like on my desk you can cut

01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:18.160
a table half of plastic knife and then I just threw it away and later that day I was like wait a minute

01:42:18.160 --> 01:42:21.600
and then I just like I ran to the store late at night and my mom's like what the fuck you doing

01:42:22.400 --> 01:42:26.720
just buying knives she didn't know as a youtuber like doing videos back then and I had no money

01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:30.560
or anything but I just bought like five dollars worth of plastic knives and I just grabbed one of

01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:35.200
our tables and just started cutting it and I hit record and I was like hey guys I'm gonna cut this

01:42:35.200 --> 01:42:39.760
table in half of plastic knives and then it's just like I thought it takes like four hours but

01:42:39.760 --> 01:42:44.800
like a dozen go buy I'm not even half way done and I'm just like cutting a table in half of plastic

01:42:44.800 --> 01:42:50.000
knives I don't know why it was so dumb I think if I was your mom and I was watching a video of you

01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:56.160
watching paint dry I'd be like what does Jimmy do thank him on the back end of counting to a hundred

01:42:56.160 --> 01:43:01.920
thousand right right after I dropped out of college and had to move out good times yeah he thought

01:43:01.920 --> 01:43:08.160
it was going crazy wait so you dropped out of college and then you moved out of your well I

01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.240
think have we talked I don't think we talked about that I don't know okay we'll talk about college

01:43:12.240 --> 01:43:17.120
yeah so I didn't want to go college I don't yeah but I sure you should I'm not saying it's bad

01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:22.000
but for me I hate I hate school I hate it I hate it I hate it I just want to make YouTube videos

01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:26.640
it's all I ever want to do that's all I ever wanted to do but I didn't have the best grades in school

01:43:26.640 --> 01:43:32.000
didn't really have a job I wasn't making enough after I graduated high school so my mom was just like

01:43:32.000 --> 01:43:36.240
either you go to college or you move out like you're not going to live here and not go to college

01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:40.320
and whatever she wants what's best for me she's not her being mean it's like obviously she didn't

01:43:40.320 --> 01:43:44.000
think this magical YouTube thing would work out so she's like you got to have some type of

01:43:44.000 --> 01:43:50.720
future you can't just bet it all on the internet forever till you die and um yeah so I just I

01:43:50.720 --> 01:43:54.560
want I need to say the story in a way where it doesn't make my mom sound mean because she she

01:43:54.560 --> 01:43:58.880
she did it because she loves me but um so I go to college just community college it's not that

01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:05.040
expensive whatever and I just couldn't stand it man it made me just so depressed I just I hate it

01:44:05.040 --> 01:44:10.720
I hate so I just want to be a YouTuber that's it and so after two weeks literally just two weeks

01:44:10.720 --> 01:44:15.200
I just stopped going but I didn't have enough money to move out I wasn't making anything so I

01:44:15.200 --> 01:44:19.760
just didn't tell my mom and I would act like it was going to college and then I would like just

01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:25.360
sit in my car in the college campus and just work on videos or edit or um just work on a script

01:44:25.360 --> 01:44:29.600
or something and then I'd come home and I'd be like hey mom college is great and then I'd keep

01:44:29.600 --> 01:44:34.640
working and um that can't last for that long yeah no and thankfully I don't I don't remember what

01:44:34.640 --> 01:44:38.240
happened I remember sitting in like on the stairs in front of one of the college classrooms

01:44:38.240 --> 01:44:42.000
I was like talking to James one of the people you met and I was like yo I don't know what the

01:44:42.000 --> 01:44:45.280
fuck's going on but like I've just been grinding grinding every hour of the day and I just made

01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.880
like 20 grand a month I was like I'm I'm ready to like tell mom I that I'm failing every class

01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:56.080
and I I'm I'm move out tomorrow he's like okay and I just I picture that because it's like 11 pm

01:44:56.080 --> 01:45:00.640
and I'm just pacing and then I'm like yeah mom I I'm I have zeros and everything I haven't been

01:45:00.640 --> 01:45:05.760
going and I was like I'm move out tomorrow and then I moved out the next day and she was so mad

01:45:05.840 --> 01:45:10.880
but I was starting to finally make money and so I could afford to move out and there you go how much

01:45:10.880 --> 01:45:16.640
longer after it was uh it that your mom started working with you probably then a year after that

01:45:16.640 --> 01:45:20.400
yeah and then I quickly got to the point where I was making her whole salary every month and it was

01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:24.000
like why are you working and people thought I was dumb the first thing I did was retired my mom

01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.640
and people were like why would you do that you should see me for yourself and I was like I love

01:45:28.640 --> 01:45:33.200
my mom she's great I'm actually the best mom of the planet like your mom's second

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:39.280
but yeah I put her through a lot with poor grades poor everything and like I mean in a world

01:45:39.280 --> 01:45:45.280
where like you know I feel college and nothing comes out of this YouTube thing it's just funny

01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:51.840
I think what I could tell from meeting your mom was that your mom loves like the story of you

01:45:52.320 --> 01:45:57.920
yeah becoming who you are today she loves it so much yeah around all the other studios and

01:45:57.920 --> 01:46:02.480
offices and there's really like there's no photos of you on the wall for the most part there's no

01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:08.480
pictures from videos screenshots there's a lot of play buttons a lot of play buttons I'll say that

01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:11.920
I'm sure they're playing a clip of them there's a lot of play buttons yeah but it wasn't until we

01:46:11.920 --> 01:46:17.680
went to the office where your mom works yeah we walk in and it's like a Mr. Beast museum

01:46:18.560 --> 01:46:24.160
and I was like okay so she's the one who's nostalgic yeah about this entire journey yeah because

01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:30.000
I met before I did that thing like two weeks into college I was like how I was like trying

01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:33.360
to go shit with my mom I was like all right here's the deal I'll go to college if you do all my

01:46:33.360 --> 01:46:39.360
homework you do all the homework she's like no I was like I was like I can't do this I was like I

01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:44.640
have to make videos like this is this makes me sad this makes me happy and she's like this doesn't

01:46:44.640 --> 01:46:49.360
make money this will make money and I'm like but this makes me happy and she's like no and that's

01:46:49.360 --> 01:46:53.440
I forgot that part that's when I stopped coming my mom wouldn't agree to do all my homework

01:46:54.240 --> 01:46:58.320
now there's funny stories and I don't know why so early in the semester we had this but we had

01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:03.680
to pair up with random people to do a project and I had a partner and I just never came back and

01:47:03.680 --> 01:47:08.000
like I completely forgot about it but we were supposed to be working on something and like three

01:47:08.000 --> 01:47:12.880
months later he messaged me all right no three months all right jump like I'm like two weeks later

01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:18.720
he was like yo we still doing this and I was like I'm never coming back to college and he's like so

01:47:18.720 --> 01:47:24.960
do I tell the professor and then he messaged me like two months later he's like oh yeah they

01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:29.360
ended up going easy on me because my partner left and he like called me and told me about it and

01:47:29.360 --> 01:47:34.160
like it was like the writing bit in the class because she just we got a project together assigned

01:47:34.160 --> 01:47:39.360
and then I just never came back and he just left with the whole thing and everyone else had a partner

01:47:39.360 --> 01:47:43.280
well you may have gotten him a better grade through sympathy exactly that's what he said and so

01:47:43.280 --> 01:47:47.680
I'm glad it worked out for him but it was funny I felt so bad it's funny your mom told us that

01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:53.200
story too about how when you started making more than her paycheck every month like that's when

01:47:53.200 --> 01:47:58.400
she was like oh wow that's a huge we didn't have any money yeah like again I want to over

01:47:58.400 --> 01:48:04.000
dramaticize it but we really didn't have much and so like second I could like she didn't have to work

01:48:04.000 --> 01:48:08.160
twice on Wednesdays and maybe could take a little bit of time off and she could like actually

01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:12.880
breathe for the first time in her life and stuff like that how did she like see that yeah like where

01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:18.080
was that money coming from from ad sensor from brand deals or from everything I mean I wasn't

01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:22.320
selling merch yeah I mean I was probably doing brand deals for no I didn't even do my first

01:48:22.320 --> 01:48:27.280
brand deal until I moved out because I that the 10k brand deals my first one and that was when I was

01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:31.600
living at my new house so that was after I dropped out so yeah I was probably doing like 20 30

01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:36.960
grand a month in ad revenue so whoever gave you that first 10k brand deal got a lot of bank for

01:48:36.960 --> 01:48:42.240
their buck item from quit yeah got it yeah which he works at current now and he's really smart oh

01:48:42.240 --> 01:48:47.840
that's cool he's cool we still work together to this day it's funny because he's crazy yeah that's

01:48:47.840 --> 01:48:52.960
crazy yeah you've had a lot of long-term relationships with with these because I'm not going anywhere

01:48:52.960 --> 01:48:58.880
I'm gonna be here in 10 years yeah that's interesting like with honey in with with current like those

01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:04.400
are like that now it sounds like it's even longer term with Adam that's cool exactly I mean

01:49:04.400 --> 01:49:08.560
hiring Adam is cheat codes for your company because he just knows so many creators and like

01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:12.400
if he was a set some company that's doing like a million dollars a year in revenue or whatever I'd

01:49:12.400 --> 01:49:15.920
still probably work with them just because I like do you know what I mean yeah it's kind of funny

01:49:15.920 --> 01:49:21.600
so this space now this is now the official like biggest single investment you've made of course

01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:27.760
by a 20 billion fold and as we like you guys are only seeing the inside of this space but there's

01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:33.360
also a lot of space yeah I don't know if I want to go too in depth but more acres than you could

01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.680
ever need we're going to build 20,000 square feet of office we're going to build a replica of this

01:49:37.680 --> 01:49:43.280
I mean the problem is like I talked about before if you you know we have multiple warehouses but

01:49:43.280 --> 01:49:47.840
if you since the videos take months to do and you know when I want to upload and I do a world

01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:53.360
for a month so any videos take 90 days to do you know what I mean like that's 12 videos that in

01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:58.080
the next 90 days you got to do and and if you're not working on them now then they won't happen

01:49:58.080 --> 01:50:02.800
at 90 days and so it's the bottlenecks space you know what I mean like I've told you guys

01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:08.160
this a million times this is for for you guys like if you know one video is taking up all of our

01:50:08.160 --> 01:50:13.120
studio well we have 11 other videos to work on they can't have until that and so we just need

01:50:13.120 --> 01:50:17.600
tons of space to be able to work on videos months in advance because if we don't they don't happen

01:50:17.600 --> 01:50:24.560
you know what I mean what do you think would be like a dream collaboration or dream video to do

01:50:24.560 --> 01:50:28.560
out of here do you have something like that oh dream collaboration or dream video

01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:38.160
not dream but yeah like dream yeah yeah I mean if he did a face reveal

01:50:38.160 --> 01:50:43.360
yeah he would be like me get the call for that but if he did like and one of our videos he just

01:50:43.360 --> 01:50:49.440
pulled out his mask that would be yeah yeah just all them I mean if I can pick whatever I want

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:55.200
yeah craft the ultra viral video it'd be like corpse and dream and all these people lined up

01:50:55.200 --> 01:51:00.320
and it's just like the one after another just take the mask off guaranteed 200 million views

01:51:00.320 --> 01:51:05.920
I know I wait when we were playing basketball last night and Sapnap was like yeah live with dream I was like

01:51:05.920 --> 01:51:14.880
oh wow so you've seen the baby you want to sketch it out for us ask you or do I not ask you

01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:22.640
what do I do what color is size yeah that's funny yeah that would be a very viral video yeah

01:51:22.640 --> 01:51:27.360
of course well obviously that one you just don't need all this space for that that's true or

01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:31.920
maybe you do maybe you do it in a way where you do need space my dream is uploading consistently

01:51:31.920 --> 01:51:37.040
which yeah that that is a bigger thing um we just we're all like some months I don't even upload

01:51:37.040 --> 01:51:40.880
videos some months we upload four videos some months we upload one it's just like what does

01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:44.480
consistently mean for you is that once a week or is that or you're just saying any right now I just

01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:48.000
want to upload once a week but to a long term in the future like three plus years from now I'd

01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:52.320
love to get to the point where we're doing two original giant spectacles never wore seem better than

01:51:52.320 --> 01:51:58.080
everyone else fucking huge ginormous best video in the game world videos twice a week do you think

01:51:58.080 --> 01:52:02.240
that any of your other videos are sorry do you think any of the other channels will pass your

01:52:02.240 --> 01:52:08.000
main channel ever no I mean even like foreign language even like India like could India the

01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:13.760
Hindi one could that pass the main one audience wise more people could watch it but I doubt it would

01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:17.520
pass the main just because you know it's dumb it will get up there though large percentage like

01:52:17.520 --> 01:52:21.520
that's fun y'all channel and I'm sure you're you're showing it as we're doing this like it's

01:52:21.520 --> 01:52:25.840
getting two plus million views per video and you know I mean it's the same videos stop you know

01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:31.440
I mean yeah so which is that already is wild for dub content totally but it's like this it's

01:52:31.440 --> 01:52:36.320
actually a classic strategy and every other yeah every day or whatever yeah or a huge

01:52:36.320 --> 01:52:41.520
bit of anime and like I saw this one video of Naruto where they like compare a really emotional

01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:44.960
scene in like 10 different languages and it's just fun I mean when I used to go to India when I

01:52:44.960 --> 01:52:48.960
was a kid I would watch friends and Hindi like really you know it's up there yeah and like do you

01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:55.280

01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:35.600
what someone else is saying it's a different language you can sort of like surrender the fact that

01:53:35.600 --> 01:53:40.880
you need to understand exactly that you need to pay like pay attention to comprehend you're just

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:45.440
listening I kind of get that you know yeah we're just like I do I don't have to I just get to

01:53:45.440 --> 01:53:49.680
enjoy that yeah I just sit there and lullaby yeah yeah but that's why visual storytelling is so

01:53:49.680 --> 01:53:53.600
important like just stuff that doesn't need language that's like the stuff that at least I've

01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:58.480
seen ghost the most what and I know we've been going on for a while but now it is the time to hit

01:53:58.480 --> 01:54:03.360
us the most important question because you're re-hoking the viewers you're telling them this video

or actually no you're telling that we would give away a thousand we did it we didn't we filmed it

01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:27.600
