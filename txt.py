  prompt="I'm burnt down screw this we need just 20 million dollars Netflix. How much would you pay me? Yeah, we're in to do every other day. We'd have mental breakdowns. You're funny. You want a job? Just put this out there. I did not enjoy being married. Why? She's a quarrelist right now. So I make videos. What's up everyone? Welcome to the Colin and Samir show. I'm Samir. I'm Colin and every week on this channel we talk about the latest in the world of creators. So if that interests you,make sure to subscribe. After we put out our breakdown video about our time with Mr. Beast, a lot of people in the comments were asking for the full interview. This is the longest episode on our channel, but for us experiencing 72 hours with Jimmy was so educational and we pulled so much value from just being with him. I feel like spending the time to watch this full interview can really teach you a lot about Mr. Beast and just a lot about the career of being a creator. This episode of the Colin and Samir shows brought to you by Jelly Smack. If you want to check them out, the link is in the description, but more on them later in this episode. Colin, roll the intro. All right, so I have a question for you. Can you describe to everyone watching where we are right now? Yes, so I got a mic on so I can move around a little bit. I just bought this brand new studio and a hundred acres of land around it. This is where we're filming all our videos going from, not all, but all our indoor shoots going forward. I mean, ask me more questions. There's so much to talk about. How much do this cost and how long in the making has this been? So the land around it, obviously the studio, the renovations and everything, and obviously we don't pay it all up front, but in total it'll cost over $10 million. But it's probably not a good way to start it because there's so much explanation. It seems excessive. Why would you just buy this? The reason we bought this is because I've spent the entire day explaining to you, we had office and a bigger office than a studio, than a bigger studio, than a third studio, and now it's consolidating. It's a weird way to start it because now it just sounds like I'm being expensive and lavish for no reason. There's a strategic reason why. You know what I mean? You obviously, you started in your bedroom at the cost of zero. Exactly. But still, I'd love to work our way up, not just go, hey, look at this because now I just seem like some dumber to YouTube. So not only are we here in your brand new studio, we're here in your hometown. And I think that's been one of the most interesting things to experience is spending a day with you here, even spending time with your mom, even some of the places in the context, that's a fun sentence. But even spending time here in your hometown, like we've met people who grew up with you, which is really interesting. Like everyone asks us, like I think people know that we're from out of town. So like, hey, what are you guys doing here? Yeah. We're filming, you know, some content. They're like, oh, Mr. Beast. Yeah. Oh, I played baseball with him. And it's really interesting to meet people and recognize like you are still in your hometown. And a lot of people who are from small towns in the US, they think like, I got to get out of this town to find success. So why did you stay in this town? And how do you think you found success staying here? Honestly, it really was easier to just stay here. You know, as I started making the videos bigger and bigger and hiring people and I got warehouses and studios like you get so anchored down like, well, you're just going to relocate all your employees to LA and buy a studio space there that costs 10 times more. And why? You know, like, what are the negatives of being in a small town? I would argue with the internet and things like zoom where you can talk to everyone and we're so interconnected like there really is no need to pay 12% more tax because of what is it? State tax in California. And then on top of that pay like three to five times more for rent and all this other stuff. It's kind of it's almost silly to be there for people in our position. Did it ever cross your mind though that maybe you're missing out on opportunity to collaborate like not really never. No, I mean, if you're good enough friends with someone they'll come down like you guys can down here. There's someone I really want to hang out with like or actually just fly there when I need to that blog is going to know I mean it's dead now. Thank you. Thank you for getting rid of it. But you know, like if I really want to hang out with someone they can just come down. You know what I mean? It's like a four hour flight. Yeah, I actually think on the inverse spending the day with you and like shadowing what at least half a day looks like I don't even think we saw your full day. We met up with you in the middle of the day. That's true. Yeah. And it was like boom, boom, boom, we were going like thing to thing to thing. And I think what I realized was being somewhere like this the positives actually outweigh the negatives so much in that there's so much focus. And you are like you're really moving from thing to thing to thing. Like I think we watched you workshop about four videos in such a short amount of time. Yeah. And that I thought was one of the most interesting things and just sitting there in those meetings, understanding how you're thinking about what needs to happen. And then additionally having the facilities and the team members who are ready to custom make things for the stories. Like I don't know if people realize I didn't realize and I've been watching your videos I've talked to you we've interviewed you. I didn't realize that every set is like custom built for the video based on the story somewhere. Yeah. But I mean you would think that okay let's reuse that or let's you know we could let's see how many videos we can film in this set. Gotcha. But you know what I mean like it's just like it's part of the story. Great. So you started in your bedroom. Yep. What point did you start re like investing into the videos at a different scale? Great question. Literally put on me the entire time when I used to make like a dollar day I saved up for months and I bought a microphone way worse than this microphone and then I saved up for like half a year and I bought a computer. I and I the whole time was like recording on my iPhone. So I was recording and editing on my iPhone when I first started and then I got a microphone you can plug in. I got a computer to edit on and then after like two years of just filming on my phone I had a hundred plus thousand subscribers but I still didn't have a camera because there was things cost like a thousand bucks or I was stupid. I didn't realize you could probably like get you seven extra four hundred dollars. So then I bought a camera and after that I bought monitors for my computer and I just kept going and re investing and then I tip pizza delivery people a hundred bucks and then I tipped a homeless man 10 grand and then you know gave away cars gave away houses and last hand take take hand off a million dollars keeps in basically the entire time. So like for the last like eight or nine years like every dollar made I just spent it the next month on content and I just did that every single month and it just kept getting bigger and bigger and here we are. You give away millions of dollars now five hundred thousand dollars at a time like large sums of money but when you first started giving away five thousand or ten thousand. But it's first started with a hundred dollars literally like even less than that like donating like a ten bucks to twitch streamers and stuff like that but like the first real IRL one I would order a pizza and I'd tip a hundred bucks I think I did like three in that video so it was like three hundred dollars. But when it gets to ten thousand that's when I think the people and I would imagine people around you like your mom are probably like Jimmy what yep. Are you sure about that exactly like what was her reaction to that? Well so I did my first brand deal I'm sure you guys have heard the story but for people that know I was offered five grand for a video but this is when I was like 19 and there's so much money it's like mom look look and I was like double it and I'll walk outside and I'll give it to homeless person and they're like no you won't that's like double it and I like pacing around my name for three hours convincing this guy like on the phone just double the money I promise the video will go viral and I'll give it to homeless person I was like ten thousand dollars just looks better in a title it'll get more views I promise you're your apple do better and I end up getting ten thousand dollars and then gave it away and my mom's like why don't you just give it like eight thousand dollars nine thousand why all ten thousand I was like mommy will look better at the title and it's just better you know and that's basically that yeah how did you know that you know giving away a hundred bucks I guess it's natural but like why why does it make such good content like well I mean those thingsand then did something I've always enjoyed like even when I was I don't say poor I don'tover dramaticize that my story like you know we weren't ever the poor but I didn't have as muchmoney if I saw homeless person I would you know over my wallet and give them almost all the moneyhad it's just fun you know because then you see the reaction their face light up stuff like that and so it kind of was just something I always enjoyed because there there's so much easier ways to give views back then then like having to give away money and and less stressful stuff butI just enjoyed it and I thought it was interesting to see people's reactions and like to try to like they're expecting a dollar and you give them 100 and they're like oh my god you know yeah um so just kind of like a mixture of what I thought was interesting but also what I enjoy if that makes sense were there other people when you're growing up making YouTube videos here around me yeah no no that was the biggest problem is I thought it was a freaking nature because like people would tell me all you do is talk about YouTube you're too obsessed with YouTube like get alive like from 13 to like 19 I never met anyone who cared about YouTube like not even out and so I was so untalkative people thought like there was problems with me because I just wouldn't talk to anyone because all I would do is talk about YouTube and after a while like you realize like no one cares like you just get labeled as the guy that just only likes YouTube and and so I kind of just like didn't talk at all and then when I was 19 and I had like 10,000 subscribers maybe it's like 18 and that's when I started meeting a few other YouTubers online and I realized like I'm not a freak I'm just like obsessed with YouTube like get alive like from 13 to like 19 I never met anyone who cared about YouTube like not even out and so I was so untalkative people thought like there was problems with me because I just wouldn't talk to anyone because all I would do is talk about YouTube and after a while like you realize like no one cares like you just get labeled as the guy that just only likes YouTube and so I kind of just like didn't talk at all and then when I was 19 and I had like 10,000 subscribers maybe it's like 18 and that's when I started meeting a few other YouTubers online and I realized like I'm not a freak I'm just like obsessed with YouTube and that's okay is you know you just got to find other people that are like that most people want to talk about South Park when you're younger or when I was younger cartoons or whatever and I backed in was figure out how to drop ship or how to better edit a video or stuff like that like bring that up at a high school lunch table well I guess now people care yeah bring that up at a high school lunch table 10 years ago and see what they say they're like the fuck you talking about what's interesting is I went back and I you know I did this a while ago but I did it recently again where I go to oldest uploaded videos on your channel you have some videos that are actually kind of similar to the videos we make where you were talking about other creators and how they were yeah yeah yeah yeah so you would play Call of Duty and then you would talk about yeah other creators I thought that was really interesting study so hardcore like there's I don't remember the youtubers name but some youtubers ad revenue he was hacked and it was leaked and it showed that he did made like 300 grand over three years and I made like two videos on that and I was just so shocked I was like guys and I remember like telling everyone I know and they're all like who cares I was like guys youtubers can make money yeah yeah I thought it was just cool to be did you know they can make money I'm like a stupid teenager like really young I was like how is this possible I was like that's so much money that's more than like my mom makes you know like so many years and I was I was mind blown and like I would find stuff like that and just make videos on it because I thought it was cool and some of those like you were uploading Minecraft videos called duty videos\n\nwrite minutes of meeting for the above conversation",
